<p class="center ft140">RUINS OF ANCIENT CITIES.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<h2>NO. I.&mdash;MESSENE.</h2>

<p>Pausanias<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> appears to have had great interest in
the history of the Messenians; for his history of
their wars is more minute and animated than any
other part of his narrative. His account of the city
gives us a grand idea of what it must once have
been; and the present splendid remains produce a
conviction of his veracity.</p>

<p>The walls of Messene<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>, built of hewn stone,
crowned with battlements, and flanked with towers,
were stronger and higher than those of Byzantium,
Rhodes, and the other cities of Greece. They included
within their circuit Mount Ithome. It had
a large public square or forum, ornamented with
temples, statues, and a splendid fountain. Beautiful
edifices were on every side.</p>

<p>The Messenians had several wars with the Lacedæmonians;
and at one time were so unfortunate as
to be reduced to the condition of the Helots. They
were at length, however, reinstated by the Thebans,
who took their city from the Spartans, who had
possessed it a long time, after having expelled all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>its inhabitants. Those who were dispersed in different
regions of Greece, Italy, and Sicily, on the first
notice given them, returned with incredible joy:
animated by the love of their country, natural to all
men, and almost as much by their hatred of the
Spartans, which length of time had only increased.
They built themselves a city, which, from the ancient
name, was called Messene.</p>

<p>After their return they fell out with the Achaians,
and having worsted their celebrated general, Philop&#339;men,
they had the meanness and atrocity to put
him to death. His history is thus related by
Rollin:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dinocrates, the Messenian, had drawn off Messene
from the Achaian league; and was meditating how
he might best seize upon a considerable post near
that city. Philop&#339;men, then seventy years of age,
and generalissimo of the Achaians for the eighth
time, lay sick. However, the instant the news of
this was brought him, he set out, notwithstanding
his indisposition, made a counter-march, and advanced
towards Messene with a small body of forces.
Dinocrates, who had marched out against him, was
soon put to flight; but five hundred troopers, who
guarded the open country of Messene, happening to
come up and reinforce him, he faced about and
routed Philop&#339;men. This general, who was solicitous
of nothing but to save the gallant youths who
had followed him in this expedition, performed the
most extraordinary acts of bravery; but happening
to fall from his horse, and receiving a deep wound in
the head, he was taken prisoner by the enemy, who
carried him to Messene.</p>

<p>&#8220;Upon the arrival of the news that Philop&#339;men
was taken prisoner, and on his way to the city, the
Messenians ran to the gates; not being able to persuade
themselves of the truth of what they heard,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
till they saw him themselves; so greatly improbable
did this relation appear to them. To satisfy the
violent curiosity of the inhabitants, many of whom
had not yet been able to get a sight of him, they
were forced to show the illustrious prisoner on the
theatre. When they beheld Philop&#339;men, dragged
along in chains, most of the spectators were so moved
to compassion, that the tears trickled from their eyes.
There even was heard a murmur among the people,
which resulted from humanity, and a very laudable
gratitude; &#8220;That the Messenians ought to call to mind
the great services done by Philop&#339;men, and his preserving
the liberty of Achaia, by the defeat of Nabis
the tyrant.&#8221; But the magistrates did not suffer him
to be long exhibited in this manner, lest the pity of
the people should be attended with ill consequences.
They therefore took him away on a sudden; and,
after consulting together, caused him to be conveyed
to a place called the Treasury. This was a subterraneous
place, whither neither light nor air entered
from without, and had no door to it, but was shut
with a huge stone that was rolled over the entrance
of it. In this dungeon they imprisoned Philop&#339;men,
and posted a guard round every part of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;As soon as it was night, and all the people were
withdrawn, Dinocrates caused the stone to be rolled
away, and the executioner to descend into the dungeon
with a dose of poison to Philop&#339;men, commanding
him not to stir till he had swallowed it. The
moment the illustrious Megalopolitan perceived the
first glimmerings of light, and saw the man advance
towards him, with a lamp in one hand and a sword
in the other, he raised himself with the utmost difficulty,
for he was very weak, sat down, and then
taking the cup, he inquired of the executioner, whether
he could tell what was become of the young
Megalopolitans his followers, particularly Lycortas?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
The executioner answering, that he heard almost all
had saved themselves by flight, Philop&#339;men thanked
him by a nod, and looking kindly on him,&mdash;&#8220;You
bring me,&#8221; says he, &#8220;good news; and I find we are
not entirely unfortunate;&#8221; after which, without
breathing the least complaint, he swallowed the
deadly dose, and laid himself again on his cloak.
The poison was very speedy in its effects; for Philop&#339;men,
being extremely weak and feeble, expired
in a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;When the news of his death spread among the
Achaians, all their cities were inexpressibly afflicted.
Immediately all their young men who were of age
to bear arms, and all their magistrates, came to Megalopolis.
Here a grand council being summoned, it
was unanimously resolved not to delay a moment
the revenge of so horrid a deed; and, accordingly,
having elected on the spot Lycortas for their general,
they advanced with the utmost fury into Messene,
and filled every part of it with blood and slaughter.
The Messenians having now no refuge left, and being
unable to defend themselves by force of arms, sent a
deputation to the Achaians, to desire that an end
might be put to the war, and to beg pardon for their
past faults. Lycortas, moved at their intreaties, did
not think it advisable to treat them as their furious
and insolent revolt seemed to deserve. He told
them that there was no other way for them to expect
a peace, but by delivering up the authors of
the revolt, and of the death of Philop&#339;men; to submit
all their affairs to the disposal of the Achaians,
and to receive a garrison into their citadel. These
conditions were accepted, and executed immediately.
Dinocrates, to prevent the ignominy of dying by an
executioner, laid violent hands on himself, in which
he was imitated by all those who had advised the
putting Philop&#339;men to death.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>A mere village<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> now occupies the site of Messene,
and this is situated on its ruins, about three quarters
of a mile from the great gate, which, of its kind, is
the most magnificent ruin in Greece.</p>

<p>A circular wall, composed of large regular blocks,
incloses an area of sixty-two feet diameter. In this
wall are two gates, one facing Cyparissaii, and the
other looking towards Laconia. The architraves
have fallen; but that which belonged to the Laconian
gate remains entire, with one end on the ground,
and the other leaning against the wall.</p>

<p>There are the remains, also, of a stadium, and of a
theatre, one of the smallest in Greece. Several other
traces, masses of fine walls, and heaps of stones, that
are scattered about the place, are overgrown or
nearly concealed by large trees and luxuriant
shrubs<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h2>NO. II.&mdash;MYCEN&AElig;.</h2>

<p>This city was the capital of Agamemnon, who was
the commander-in-chief of the assembled Greeks,
before the walls of Troy. This event took place,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span> 1184; and the present ruins are supposed to
be the ruins of the city before that event.</p>

<p>Perseus translated the seat of his kingdom from
Argos to Mycenæ. The kings who reigned at Mycenæ,
after Perseus, were Erectryon, Sthenelus, and
Eurystheus. The last, after the death of Hercules,
declared open war against his descendants, apprehending
they might some time or other attempt to
dethrone him; which, as it happened, was done by
the Heraclidæ; for, having killed Eurystheus in
battle, they entered victorious into Peloponnesus;
and made themselves masters of the country. But
a plague obliged them to quit the country. Three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>years after this, being deceived by the ambiguous
expression of the oracle, they made a second attempt,
which likewise proved fruitless. This was about
twenty years before the taking of Troy.</p>

<p>Atreus, the son of Pelops, uncle by the mother&#8217;s
side to Eurystheus, was the latter&#8217;s successor. And
in this manner the crown came to the descendants of
Pelops, from whom Peloponnesus, which before was
called Apia, derived its name. The bloody hatred of
the two brothers, Atreus and Thyestes, is known to
all the world.</p>

<p>Plisthenes, the son of Atreus, succeeded his father
in the kingdom of Mycenæ, which he left to his son
Agamemnon, who was succeeded by his son Orestes.</p>

<p>The kingdom of Mycenæ was filled with enormous
and horrible crimes, from the time it came into the
family of Pelops.</p>

<p>Tisamenes and Penthilus, sons of Orestes, reigned
after their father, and were at last driven out by the
Heraclidæ.</p>

<p>The length of the Acropolis of Mycenæ, is about
four hundred yards,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> and its breadth about two
hundred. The whole circuit of this citadel can still
be made out; and, in some places, the walls remain
to the height of fifteen or twenty feet. They are
constructed of huge stones, and belong to that style
of building commonly called Cyclopean. This description
of wall building is recognised by its massy
materials, and by a certain style of rudeness; in
which, however, different epochs are easily distinguished.
The oldest part of the walls of Mycenæ,
resembles the Cyclopean walls of Tiryns, a place to
the south, about seven miles distant, which are apparently
nothing more than huge masses of unwrought
stone, placed one above another, with the interstices
filled up by smaller materials.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>The citadel of Mycenæ is of an irregular oblong
form, and is now chiefly an object of curiosity for
the gate, or great entrance, to the north and west
angle. The approach to this gate is by a passage
of fifty feet long, and thirty wide, formed by two
parallel and projecting walls, which was a part of
the fortification, and were obviously designed to command
the entrance, and annoy any enemy who might
venture to attack the place. The door is formed of
three stones, two upright, and a cross-stone, forming
a soffit. This last is fifteen feet long, four wide, and
six feet seven inches thick in the middle, but diminishes
towards each end. On this stone stands
another of a triangular shape, which is twelve feet
long, ten high, and two thick. Two lions are cut
in relief on the face of this stone, standing on their
hind legs, on opposite sides of a round pillar, on
which their forepaws rest.</p>

<p>The kingdom of the Argives<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> was divided into
two portions, by Acrisius and his brother Pr&#339;tus.
Argos and Mycenæ were their capitals. These, as
belonging to the same family, and distant only about
six miles and a quarter from each other, had one
tutelary deity, Juno; and were, jointly, proprietors
of her temple, the Heræum. This renowned temple
was adorned with curious sculpture, and numerous
statues. The image was very large, made by Polycletus,
of gold and ivory, sitting on a throne.
Among the offerings was a shield, taken by Menelaus,
from Euphorbus, at Ilium; an altar of silver,
on which the marriage of Hebe with Hercules was
represented; a golden crown and purple robe, given
by Nero; and a peacock of gold, set with precious
stones, dedicated by Hadrian.</p>

<p>Near it were the remains of a more ancient temple,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
which had been burned; a taper setting some garlands
on fire, while the priestess was sleeping.</p>

<p>The cause of the destruction of Mycenæ is said to
have been this:&mdash;Eighty of its heroes accompanied
the Spartans to the defile of Thermopylæ, and shared
with them the glory of their immortal deed. This is
said so to have excited the jealousy of their sister city,
Argos, that it was never afterwards forgiven. The
Argives, stung by the recollection of the opportunity
they had thus lost of signalising themselves, and
unable to endure the superior fame of their neighbours,
made war against Mycenæ, and destroyed
it. This event happened about five centuries before
Christ. We cannot, however, believe that the Argives,
who were an exceedingly mild and benevolent
people, could have done such an act of atrocity
as this.</p>

<p>Strabo could not imagine where Mycenæ could
have stood. He says, that not a single vestige
remained. Pausanias, however, who lived at a
much later period, found its colossal ruins, and
described them as they are seen at this very day.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not,&#8221; says Dr. Clarke, &#8220;merely the circumstance
of seeing the architecture and the sculpture of
the heroic ages, which renders a view of Mycenæ one
of the highest gratifications a literary traveller can
experience; the consideration of its remaining at this
time, exactly as Pausanias saw it in the second
century, and in such a state of preservation, that an
alto-relievo, described by him, yet exists in the
identical position he has assigned for it, adds greatly
to the interest excited by these remarkable ruins:
indeed, so singularly does the whole scene correspond
with his account of the place, that, in comparing
them together, it might be supposed, a single hour
had not elapsed since he was himself upon the
spot.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>Everything<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> conspires to render these ruins pre-eminently
interesting; whether we consider their
venerable age, the allusions made to them in such
distant periods, when they were visited by Sophocles,
Euripides and other poets and historians of Greece,
as the classical antiquities of their country; or the
indisputable examples they afford of the architecture,
sculpture, mythology and customs of the heroic ages.</p>

<p>The walls consist of huge unhewn masses of stone,
so fitted and adapted to each other, as to have given
rise to an opinion, that the power of man was inadequate
to the labour necessary in building them.</p>

<p>One of the first things that is noticed is a tumulus
of an immense size. This has been opened,
and the entrance is no longer concealed. This
sepulchre has been erroneously called the &#8220;treasury
of Atreus;&#8221; and the &#8220;monument of Agamemnon.&#8221;
&#8220;That this sepulchre,&#8221; says Clarke, &#8220;could not have
been the treasury of Atreus, is evident from Pausanias&#8216;s
description, because it was <i>without</i> the walls of the
Acropolis; and that it cannot be the monument of
Agamemnon, because it was <i>within</i> the citadel.&#8221;</p>

<p>In regard to the tomb of Agamemnon, the following
account has been given by Mr. Turner: &#8220;I
entered by a subterraneous passage, opened by Lord
Elgin, and was surprised to find myself in an immense
dome, about ninety feet high, and fifty round the
bottom. It had two doors, one into the open air,
and another into an interior chamber, which was
thoroughly dark, and, I was told, very small. It was
built of immense stones, and was in excellent preservation.
The tomb being subterraneous, there are no
traces above-ground, and you might walk over it for
years, without suspecting that you were walking over
so interesting a ruin.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other antiquities must remain for the more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>attentive examination of future travellers; who, as it
is hoped, will visit the ruins provided with the necessary
implements for making researches, where, with
the slightest precaution, they will be little liable<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> to
interruption, the place being as destitute of inhabitants,
and almost as little known, as it was in the
time of Strabo; when it was believed that not a
vestige could be found<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>.</p>

<h2>NO. III.&mdash;MILETUS.</h2>

<p>This celebrated city was the capital of Ionia,
situated, in the time of Pausanias, ten stadia from the
mouth of the Meander; but that river accumulated
its deposit, afterwards, so closely, that the town was
removed, in process of time, more than three miles
within the land. Of its origin there are two accounts:
some ascribing it to a colony from Crete, under the
conduct of Miletus; some to Sarpedon; and others to
Neleus, the son of Codrus, king of Athens, who died
there, and whose tomb was in existence for many ages.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alyattes, king of Sardis, made war upon the
Milesians in the following manner,&#8221; says Herodotus.
&#8220;As the time of harvest approached, he marched an
army into their country to the sound of the pastoral
pipe, harp, and flutes, played upon by women as well
as men. On his arrival in their territories, he neither
hunted, nor in any respect injured their edifices,
which stood in the fields; but he totally destroyed
the produce of their lands, and then returned. As
the Milesians were securely situated near the sea, all
attacks upon their city would probably have proved
ineffectual. His motive for not destroying their
buildings was, that they might be induced again to
cultivate their lands, and that on every repetition of
his excursions, he might be secure of plunder.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>In this manner the war was protracted during a
period of eleven years; the Milesians receiving no
succour from any of their neighbours, except the
natives of Chios. In the twelfth year of the war the
enemy again set fire to the corn, and a sudden
wind springing up, the flames caught the temple of
Minerva and burnt it to the ground. Alyattes, supposing
that the Milesians must be destitute of corn
from these repeated conflagrations, sent word that an
ambassador would be at Miletus to make a truce,
until he had rebuilt the temple. When Thrasybulus,
king of Miletus, heard this, he directed all the
corn that could be in any way collected, to be
brought into the public market-place; and at an
appointed time ordered the Milesians to commence a
scene of feasting and dances. When Alyattes heard
of this festivity, convinced that he had been mistaken
as to the hope of starving the Milesians out, he not
only immediately offered peace, but entered into a
strict alliance with them, and forthwith erected two
temples to Minerva instead of one.</p>

<p>The Ionians having been drawn into revolt through
the intrigues and ambitious views of two persons,
Aristagoras and Hysteius, the Persians, having
routed the Ionians, laid siege to Miletus, both by sea
and land. They not only undermined the walls, but
applied every species of military machines against it.
The oracle had declared:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And thou, Miletus, versed in ill too long,</span>
<span class="i0">Shalt be the prey and plunder of the strong:</span>
<span class="i0">Your wives shall stoop to wash a long-hair&#8217;d train,</span>
<span class="i0">And others guard our Didymæan fane.</span>
</div></div>

<p>This prophecy was fulfilled. The city was taken
and utterly destroyed. The greater part of the Milesians
were slain by the Persians, who at that time
wore long hair; and their wives and children were
carried into slavery. Those who survived, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
sent to Susa; Darius treating them with great
humanity.</p>

<p>The Milesians, continues Herodotus, on suffering
these calamities from the Persians, did not meet
with the return from the people of Sybaris, which
they might justly have expected. When Sybaris
was taken by the Crotoniati, the Milesians had
shaved their heads, and discovered every testimony
of sorrow; for betwixt these two cities a strict hospitality
prevailed. And here we must give room for
a beautiful instance of sensibility on the part of the
Athenians. When they heard of the destruction of
Miletus, they gave way to many indications of sorrow;
and some years after the capture of Miletus,
a drama, written by Phrynicus, being represented at
Athens, the whole audience melted into tears. The
poet, for thus reminding them of so terrible a calamity,
was fined a thousand drachmæ, and the piece
forbidden to be played in future.</p>

<p>A bloody battle was fought under the walls of the
town, between the Athenians and Argives on one
side, and the Peloponnesians assisted by the Persians
and the revolted Milesians on the other. The fortune
of the day turned to the side of the Athenians;
and they would have entered the city and recovered
their authority, had not a fleet of fifty-five sail,
belonging to the enemy, compelled them to draw off
their forces and retire.</p>

<p>B. C. 412<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>. In this year the inhabitants of
Miletus joined the Lacedæmonian party against
Athens. When the Athenians heard of this, they
voted the expenditure of a thousand talents, which,
in more prosperous times, they had deposited in
the citadel, under the sanction of a decree of the
senate and people, to reserve it for an occasion of the
utmost danger. This enabled them to recruit their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
fleet; and having secured the fidelity of the Lesbians,
they endeavoured to recover their authority in
Miletus.</p>

<p>Lysander of Lacedæmon acted a great atrocity at
Miletus. Apprehending that those who were then
at the head of the people, would escape his revenge,
he swore that he would do them no harm. These
chiefs, giving credit to his oath, appeared therefore
in public; but no sooner had they done so, than the
treacherous Lysander gave leave to the nobles of
the town to put them all to death, which they immediately
did, although the number amounted to no
less than eight hundred! He caused, also, an incredible
number of persons, who were of the party
opposed to him, to be massacred; and this he did
not only to gratify his own malice and revenge, but
to serve the enmity, malice, and avarice of his friends,
whom he took delight in supporting in the gratification
of their passions by the death of their enemies.</p>

<p>The Milesians, when free from a foreign yoke, were
often reduced to a state of vassalage by domestic
tyrants, who governed them with absolute sway, and
made them feel all the evils of a foreign subjection.
In the time of Antiochus II., for instance, we read of
one Timarchus, who, reigning in Miletus, and practising
all manner of cruelties, was driven out by that
prince, and rewarded by the citizens with the title of
Theos.</p>

<p>When Alexander left Ephesus, he marched to
Miletus. But the city, expecting succours from the
Persians, closed its gates against him. Memnon,
one of the most valiant commanders of Darius, who
had shut himself up in the fortress, determined to
make as stout a defence as possible. The Macedonian,
however, attacked him skilfully and vigorously,
sending fresh troops to supply the places of
those that were wearied; yet finding his troops still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
repulsed in all directions, the garrison being well supplied
with every thing necessary for a siege, he
planted all his machines against the walls, made a
great number of breaches, and attempted new scalados
wherever they were attached. At length the
besieged, after many brave efforts, fearful of being
taken by storm, capitulated. When he had succeeded,
Alexander acted in a manner much more
noble and generous than he had done before, or did
after in many cases;&mdash;he treated the Milesians with
great humanity. The foreigners, however, that had
taken part with them, he sold as slaves.</p>

<p>Miletus is thus described in the pages of Barthelemy,
whose Travels of Anacharsis, as we have before observed,
have all the authority of an ancient author:&mdash;&#8220;When
at Miletus, we surveyed with admiration its temples,
festivals, manufactures, harbours, and the innumerable
concourse of ships, mariners, and workmen, there perpetually
in motion. This city is an abode of opulence,
learning, and pleasure;&mdash;it is the Athens of Ionia.
Within the walls the city is adorned by the productions
of art; and without, embellished by the riches of nature.
How often have we directed our steps to the banks
of the Mæander, which, after having received a multitude
of rivers, and bathed the walls of various cities,
rolls its waters in innumerable windings through the
plain which is honoured by bearing its name, and
proudly ornaments its course with the plenty it
creates! How often, seated on the turf, which borders
its flowery margin, surrounded on all sides with
the most delightful prospects, and unable to satiate
our senses with the purity and serene splendour of
the air and sky, have we not felt a delicious languor
insinuate into our souls, and throw us, if I may so
speak, into the intoxication of happiness! Such is
the influence of the climate of Ionia: and as moral
causes, far from correcting, have only tended to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
increase it, the Ionians have become the most effeminate,
but, at the same time, are to be numbered
among the most amiable people, of Asiatic Greece.
In their ideas, sentiments, and manners, a certain
softness prevails, which constitute the charm of
society; and in their music and dancing is a liberty,
which at first offends, and then seduces. They have
added new charms to pleasure, and enriched their
luxury by inventions. Numerous festivals occupy
them at home, or attract them to the neighbouring
cities, where the men appear in magnificent habits,
and the women in all the elegance of female ornament,
and with all the desire of pleasing.&#8221;</p>

<p>St. Paul, in his way from Corinth to Jerusalem,
passed through Miletus; and as he went by sea, and
would not take Ephesus in his way, he caused the
priests and bishops of the church of Ephesus to come
to Miletus<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>.</p>

<p>Miletus fell under subjection to the Romans, and became
a considerable place under the Greek emperors.
Then it fell under the scourge of the Turks; one of
the sultans of which (<span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 1175) sent twenty thousand
men, with orders to lay waste the Roman imperial
provinces, and bring him sand, water, and an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
oar. All the cities on the Mæander were then
ruined: since which, little of the history of Miletus
has been known.</p>

<p>The Milesians early applied themselves to navigation;
in the spirit of which they, in the process of
time, planted not less than eighty colonies, in different
parts of the world; and as we are ourselves so largely
engaged in colonisation, perhaps an account of the
colonies, sent out by the Milesians, may not be deemed
uninteresting.</p>

<p>From this list we may imagine to what a height
of power and civilisation this city must have once
attained. Babylon stands in a wilderness and a
desert by its side.</p>

<p>Miletus was adorned with superb edifices; and was
greatly celebrated for its trade, sciences, and arts. It
gave birth also to many eminent persons; amongst
whom may be particularly mentioned, Thales<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>,
Anaximenes<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>, Anaximander<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>, Hecatæus<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>, Timotheus<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>,
also the celebrated Aspasia, the wife of
Pericles. It was also famous for its excellent wool,
with which were made stuffs and garments, held in
the highest reputation both for softness, elegance, and
beauty.</p>

<p>It had a temple dedicated to Apollo Didymæus,
which was burnt by Xerxes. The Milesians, however,
soon after rebuilt it, and upon so large a scale,
that Strabo describes it as having been equal in extent
to a village; so large indeed was it, that it could
never be covered. It stood in a thick grove. With
what magnificence and prodigious spirit this edifice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>was designed, may in some measure be collected from
the present remains. Strabo called it the &#8220;greatest
of all temples;&#8221; adding that it continued without a roof
on account of its bigness; Pausanias mentions it as
unfinished, but as one of the wonders peculiar to
Ionia; and Vitruvius mentions this among the four
temples, which have raised their architects to the
summit of renown<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>.</p>

<p>There was a magnificent theatre also built of stone,
but cased with marble, and greatly enriched with
sculptures. There was also one temple of Venus in
this town, and another in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Miletus is now called Palatskia (the palaces). Notwithstanding
its title, and the splendour of its ancient
condition, it is but a mean place now. The principal
relic of its former magnificence is a ruined theatre,
measuring in length four hundred and fifty-seven
feet. The external face of this vast fabric is marble.
The front has been removed. A few seats only
remain, and those, as usual, ranged on the slope of a
hill. The vaults which supported the extremities,
with the arches or avenues of the two wings, are
constructed with such solidity, that they will not
easily be demolished. The entrance of the vault is
nearly filled up with rubbish; but when Dr. Chandler
crept into it, led by an Armenian, with a candle in a
long paper lantern, innumerable bats began flitting
about them; and the stench was intolerable.</p>

<p>The town was spread with rubbish and overgrown
with thickets. The vestiges of &#8220;the heathen city,&#8221;
are pieces of wall, broken arches, and a few scattered
pedestals and inscriptions, a square marble urn, and
many wells. One of the pedestals has belonged to a
statue of the Emperor Hadrian, who was a friend to
the Milesians, as appears from the titles of Saviour
and Benefactor, bestowed upon him. Another has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>supported the Emperor Severus, and has a long inscription,
with this preamble: &#8220;<i>The senate and
people of the city of the Milesians, the first settled
in Ionia, and the mother of many and great cities
both in Pontus and Egypt, and in various other parts
of the world.</i>&#8221; This lies among the bushes behind
the theatre.</p>

<p>Several piers of an aqueduct are standing. Near
the ferry is a large couchant lion, of white marble;
and in a Turkish burying-ground another; and traces
remain of an old fortress. Besides these, there are a
considerable number of forsaken mosques; and among
the ruins are several fragments of ancient churches.</p>

<p>Wheler says, that in his time, there were many
inscriptions, most of them defaced by time and
weather; some upon single stones, others upon very
large tombs. On one of them were carved two
women hunting, with three dogs; the foremost holding
a hare in its mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miletus,&#8221; says Dr. Chandler, from whom we
have borrowed several passages in this article, &#8220;was
once powerful and illustrious. The early navigators
extended its commerce to remote regions; the whole
Euxine Sea, the Propontis, Egypt, and other countries,
were frequented by its ships, and settled by its
colonies. It withstood Darius, and refused to admit
Alexander. It has been styled the metropolis and
head of Ionia; the bulwark of Asia; chief in war
and peace; mighty by sea; the fertile mother,
which had poured forth her sons to every quarter.
It afterwards fell so low as to furnish a proverbial
saying, &#8216;The Milesians were once great;&#8217; but if we
compare its ancient glory, and its subsequent humiliation,
with its present state, we may justly exclaim,
&#8216;Miletus, how much lower art thou now fallen<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<h2>NO. IV.&mdash;NAUPLIA.</h2>

<p>This town, now called Napoli di Romania, is
situated along the foot of the rocky promontory,
which projects into the sea, at the head of the
gulf of Napoli. Its walls were built by the Venetians.</p>

<p>Ancient Nauplia, which is said to have been built
by Nauplius, absurdly called the son of Neptune,
became the chief naval arsenal of the Argives.
Even so early as the time of Pausanias, however,
it had become desolate; only a few remains of a
temple, and of the walls, then existing. Its modern
history is rather interesting.</p>

<p>The Venetians obtained possession in 1460. In
1495 it surrendered to Bajazet, but was again taken
by the Venetians, under Morozini, in 1586, after
a month&#8217;s siege, and became the head-quarters of
that nation, in the Morea. In 1714, it was treacherously
given up to Ali Coumourgi, and was the
seat of Turkish government, and residence of the
Pasha of the Morea; till Tripolizzi was selected
as being more central; when it became subject to
the Bey of Argos. The crescent remained uninterruptedly
flying on this fortress, till the 12th of
December 1822, when it surrendered to the Greeks,
after a long and tedious blockade; the Turkish
garrison having been reduced to such a state of
starvation, as to feed on the corpses of their companions.
In 1825, Ibrahim Pasha made a fruitless
attempt to surprise the place; and it has been the
strong-hold of the Greeks in their struggle for
liberty. In April, 1826, the commission of government
held their sittings here; but were obliged
to retire to &AElig;gina, on account of civil dissentions,
and two of the revolted chiefs being in possession
of the Palamadi. During the presidency of Capo
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
d&#8217;Istrias, who always resided, and was assassinated
in the town, it again became the seat of government;
and on the 31st of January, 1833, Otho, Prince
of Bavaria, arrived here, as first king of restored
Greece.</p>

<p>The strength of Napoli is the citadel, which is
called the Palamadi, over whose turreted walls a
few cypresses raise their sombre heads. It stands
on the easternmost and highest elevation of the
promontory, and completely overhangs and commands
the town. To all appearance it is impregnable,
and, from its situation and aspect, has been
termed the Gibraltar of Greece. It is seven hundred
and twenty feet above the sea; and has only
one assailable point, where a narrow isthmus connects
it with the main land; and this is overlooked
by a rocky precipice.</p>

<p>Mr. Dodwell made fruitless inquiries in respect to
the caves and labyrinths near Nauplia, which are
said to have been formed by the Cyclops; but a
minute examination is neither a safe nor easy undertaking.
&#8220;The remains that are yet unknown,&#8221; says
he, &#8220;will be brought to light, when the reciprocal
jealousy of the European powers permits the Greeks
to break their chains,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> and to chase from their outraged
territory that host of dull oppressors, who
have spread the shades of ignorance over the land
that was once illuminated by science, and who unconsciously
trample on the venerable dust of the
Pelopidæ and the Atridæ.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nauplia is a miserable village; the houses have
nothing peculiar about them, but are built in the
common form of the lowest habitations of the villages
of France and Savoy. The inhabitants are indolent.
&#8220;The indolence of the Napolitans,&#8221; says M. La
Martine, &#8220;is mild, serene, and gay&mdash;the carelessness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
of happiness; while that of the Greek is heavy,
morose, and sombre; it is a vice, which punishes
itself.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<h2>NO. V.&mdash;NEMEA.</h2>

<p>A town of Argolis, greatly distinguished by the
games once celebrated there. These games (called the
Nemean games) were originally instituted by the
Argives in honour of Archemorus, who died from
the bite of a serpent; and, afterwards, renewed in
honour of Hercules, who in that neighbourhood is said
to have destroyed a lion by squeezing him to death.</p>

<p>These games consisted of foot and horse races, and
chariot races; boxing, wrestling, and contests of every
kind, both gymnastic and equestrian. They were
celebrated on the 12th of our August, on the 1st and
3rd of every Olympiad; and continued long after
those of Olympia were abolished.</p>

<p>In the neighbouring mountains is still shown the
den of the lion, said to have been slain by Hercules;
near which stand the remains of a considerable
temple, dedicated to Jupiter Nemeus and Cleomenes,
formerly surrounded by a grove of cypresses.</p>

<p>Of this temple three columns only are remaining.
These columns, two of which belonging to the space
between antæ, support their architrave. These
columns are four feet six inches and a half in diameter,
and thirty-one feet ten inches and a half in
height, exclusive of the capitals. The single column
is five feet three inches diameter, and belongs
to the peristyle. The temple was hexastyle and
peripteral, and is supposed to have had fourteen
columns on the sides. The general intercolumniation
is seven feet and a half, and those at the angles
five feet eleven inches and a quarter. It stands upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
three steps, each of which is one foot two inches in
height. The capital of the exterior column has
been shaken out of its place, and will probably ere
long fall to the ground. &#8220;I have not seen in Greece,&#8221;
continues Mr. Dodwell, &#8220;any Doric temple, the
columns of which are of such slender proportions as
those of Nemea. The epistylia are thin and
meagre, and the capitals too small for the height of
the columns. It is constructed of a soft calcareous
stone, which is an aggregate of sand and small petrified
shells, and the columns are coated with a fine
stucco. Pausanias praises the beauty of the temple;
but, even in his time, the roof had fallen, and not a
single statue was left.&#8221;</p>

<p>No fragments of marble are found amongst the
ruins, but an excavation would probably be well repaid,
as the temple was evidently thrown down at
one moment, and if it contained any sculptured
marbles, they are still concealed by the ruins.</p>

<p>Near the temple are several blocks of stones, some
fluted Doric frusta, and a capital of small dimensions.
This is supposed to have formed part of the
sepulchre of Archemorus. Mr. Dodwell, however,
found no traces of the tumulus of Lycurgus, his
father, king of Nemea, mentioned by Pausanias,
nor any traces of the theatre and stadium.</p>

<p>Beyond the temple is a remarkable summit, the
top of which is flat, and visible in the gulf of
Corinth. On one side is a ruinous church, with
some rubbish; perhaps where Osspaltes and his
father are said to have been buried. Near it is a
very large fig-tree. To this a goatherd repaired
daily before noon with his flock, which huddled
together in the shade until the extreme heat was
over, and then proceeded orderly to feed in the cool
upon the mountain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nemea,&#8221; continues Mr. Dodwell, &#8220;is more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
characterised by gloom than most of the places I
have seen. The splendour of religious pomp, and
the long animation of gymnastic and equestrian
exercises, have been succeeded by the dreary vacancy
of a death-like solitude. We saw no living creatures
but a ploughman and his oxen, in a spot which was
once exhilarated by the gaiety of thousands, and
resounded with the shouts of a crowded population<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>.&#8221;</p>

<h2>NO. VI.&mdash;NINEVEH.</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of Nineveh, the mighty city of old,</span>
<span class="i0">How like a star she fell and pass&#8217;d away!</span>
<span class="i10"><span class="smcap">Atherstone.</span></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Assyrian empire was founded by Ashur, the
son of Shem, according to some writers; but according
to others, by Nimrod; and to others, by Ninus.</p>

<p>Ninus, according to Diodorus Siculus, is to be
esteemed the most ancient of the Assyrian kings.
Being of a warlike disposition, and ambitious of that
glory which results from courage, says he, he armed
a considerable number of young men, that were brave
and vigorous like himself; trained them up in laborious
exercises and hardships, and by that means
accustomed them to bear the fatigues of war patiently,
and to face dangers with intrepidity. What Diodorus
states of Ninus, however, is much more applicable
to his father, Nimrod, the son of Cush, grandson
of Cham, and great-grandson of Noah; he who
is signalised in scripture as having been &#8220;a mighty
hunter before the Lord;&#8221; a distinction which he
gained from having delivered Assyria from the fury
and dread of wild animals; and from having, also,
by this exercise of hunting, trained up his followers
to the use of arms, that he might make use of them
for other purposes more serious and extensive.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>
<p>The next king of Assyria was <span class="smcap">Ninus</span>, the son of
Nimrod. This prince prepared a large army, and in
the course of seventeen years conquered a vast extent
of country; extending to Egypt on one side, and to
India and Bactriana on the other. On his return he
resolved on building the largest and noblest city in
the world; so extensive and magnificent, as to leave
it in the power of none, that should come after him,
to build such another. It is probable, however, that
Nimrod laid the foundations of this city, and that
Ninus completed it: for the ancient writers often
gave the name of founder to persons, who were only
entitled to the appellation of restorer or improver.</p>

<p>This city was called <span class="smcap">Nineveh</span>. Its form and
extent are thus related by Diodorus, who states that
he took his account from Ctesias the Gnidian:&mdash;&#8220;It
was of a long form; for on both sides it ran out
about twenty-three miles. The two lesser angles,
however, were only ninety furlongs a-piece; so that
the circumference of the whole was about seventy-four
miles. The walls were one hundred feet in
height; and so broad, that three chariots might be
driven together upon it abreast; and on these walls
were fifteen hundred turrets, each of which was two
hundred feet high.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the improver had finished the city, he appointed
it to be inhabited by the richest Assyrians;
but gave leave, at the same time, to people of other
nations (as many as would) to dwell there; and,
moreover, allowed to the citizens at large a considerable
territory next adjoining them.</p>

<p>Having finished the city, Ninus marched into Bactria;
his army consisting of one million seven hundred
thousand men, two hundred thousand horse, and
sixteen thousand chariots armed with scythes. This
number is, doubtless, greatly exaggerated. With so
large a force, he could do no otherwise than conquer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
a great number of cities. But having, at last, laid
siege to Bactria, the capital of the country, it is said
that he would probably have failed in his enterprise
against that city, had he not been assisted by the
counsel of Semiramis, wife to one of his officers, who
directed him in what manner to attack the citadel.
By her means he entered the city, and becoming
entire master of it, he got possession of an immense
treasure. He soon after married Semiramis; her
husband having destroyed himself, to prevent the
effects of some threats that Ninus had thrown out
against him. By Semiramis, Ninus had one son,
whom he named Ninyas; and dying not long after,
Semiramis became queen: who, to honour his memory,
erected a magnificent monument, which is said
to have remained a long time after the destruction of
the city.</p>

<p>The history of this queen is so well known,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> that
we shall not enlarge upon it; we having already
done so in our account of Babylon; for she was one
of the enlargers of that mighty city.</p>

<p>There is a very great difference of opinion, in
regard to the time in which Semiramis lived. According
to</p>

<p>Alexander&#8217;s opinion of this celebrated woman may
be gathered from the following passage of his speech to
his army:&mdash;&#8220;You wish to enjoy me long; and even, if
it were possible, for ever; but, as to myself, I compute
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>the length of my existence, not by years, but by glory.
I might have confined my ambition within the narrow
limits of Macedonia; and, contented with the kingdom
my ancestors left me, have waited, in the midst
of pleasures and indolence, an inglorious old age. I
own that if my victories, not my years, are computed,
I shall seem to have lived long; but can you
imagine, that after having made Europe and Asia but
one empire, after having conquered the two noblest
parts of the world, in the tenth year of my reign and
the thirtieth of my age, that it will become me to
stop in the midst of so exalted a career, and discontinue
the pursuit of glory to which I have entirely
devoted myself? Know, that this glory ennobles all
things, and gives a true and solid grandeur to whatever
appears insignificant. In what place soever I
may fight, I shall fancy myself upon the stage of the
world, and in presence of all mankind. I confess
that I have achieved mighty things hitherto; but the
country we are now in reproaches me that a woman
has done still greater. It is Semiramis I mean. How
many nations did she conquer! How many cities
were built by her! What magnificent and stupendous
works did she finish! How shameful is it, that I
should not yet have attained to so high a pitch of
glory! Do but second my ardour, and I will soon
surpass her. Defend me only from secret cabals and
domestic treasons, by which most princes lose their
lives; I take the rest upon myself, and will be
answerable to you for all the events of the war.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This speech,&#8221; says Rollin, &#8220;gives us a perfect
idea of Alexander&#8217;s character. He had no notion of
true glory. He did not know either the principle,
the rule, or end of it. He certainly placed it where
it was not. He was strongly prejudiced in vulgar
error, and cherished it. He fancied himself born
merely for glory; and that none could be acquired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
but by unbounded, unjust, and irregular conduct. In
his impetuous sallies after a mistaken glory, he followed
neither reason, virtue, nor humanity; and as
if his ambitious caprice ought to have been a rule and
standard to all other men, he was surprised that
neither his officers nor soldiers would enter into his
views, and that they lent themselves very unwillingly
to support his ridiculous enterprises.&#8221; These remarks
are well worthy the distinguished historian who
makes them.</p>

<p>Semiramis was succeeded by her son Ninyas; a
weak and effeminate prince, who shut himself up in the
city, and, seldom engaging in affairs, naturally became
an object of contempt to all the inhabitants. His successors
are said to have followed his example; and
some of them even went beyond him in luxury and
indolence. Of their history no trace remains.</p>

<p>At length we come to Pull, supposed to be the father
of Sardanapalus; in whose reign Jonah is believed to
have lived. &#8220;The word of the Lord,&#8221; says the Hebrew
scripture, &#8220;came unto Jonah, the son of Amittai,
saying, Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and
cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before
me.&#8221; Jonah, instead of acting as he was commanded,
went to Joppa, and thence to Tarshish. He was
overtaken by a storm, swallowed by a whale, and
thrown up again. Being commanded again, he arose
and went to Nineveh, &#8220;<i>an exceedingly great city of
three days&#8217; journey</i>;&#8221; where, having warned the
inhabitants, that in forty days their city should be
overthrown, the people put on sackcloth, &#8220;from the
greatest of them even to the least.&#8221; The king sat in
ashes, and proclaimed a fast. &#8220;Let neither man nor
beast,&#8221; said the edict, &#8220;herd nor flock, taste any
thing; let them not feed, nor drink water; but let
man and beast be covered with sackcloth; and cry
mightily unto God; yea, let them turn every one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
from his evil way, and from the violence that is in
their hands. Who can tell if God will turn and
repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we
perish not?&#8221;</p>

<p>On the king&#8217;s issuing this edict, the people did as
they were commanded, and the ruin was delayed.
On finding this, the prophet acted in a very unworthy
manner. To have failed as a prophet gave him great
concern; insomuch, that he desired death. &#8220;Take,
I beseech thee, O Lord, my life from me; for it is
better for me to die than to live.&#8221; &#8220;Shall I not
spare Nineveh,&#8221; answered the Lord, &#8220;that great city,
wherein are more than six-score thousand persons,
that cannot discern between their right hand and
their left hand; and also much cattle?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sardanapalus was, beyond all other sovereigns recorded
in history, the most effeminate and voluptuous;
the most perfect specimen of sloth, luxury, cowardice,
crime, and elaborate folly, that was, perhaps,
ever before exhibited to the detestation of mankind.
He clothed himself in women&#8217;s attire, and spun fine
wool and purple amongst throngs of concubines.
He painted likewise his face, and decked his whole
body with other allurements. He imitated, also, a
woman&#8217;s voice; and in a thousand respects disgraced
his nature by the most unbounded licentiousness
and depravity. He even wished to immortalise
his impurities; selecting for his epitaph the following
lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

<span class="i0">Hæc habeo quæ edi, quæque exsaturata libido</span>
<span class="i0">Hausit; at illa jacent multa et præclara relicta.</span>

<p>&#8220;This epitaph,&#8221; says Aristotle, &#8220;is only fit for a

</div></div>

<p>In this dishonourable state Sardanapalus lived
several years. At length the governor of Media,
having gained admittance into his palace, and seen
with his own eyes a king guilty of such criminal
excesses; enraged at the spectacle, and not able to
endure that so many brave men should be subject to
a prince more soft and effeminate than the women
themselves, immediately resolved to put an end to his
dominion. He therefore formed a conspiracy against
him; and in this he was joined by Belesis, governor
of Babylon, and several others. Supporting each
other for the same end, the one stirred up the Medes
and Persians; the other inflamed the inhabitants of</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>
<p>Babylon. They gained over, also, the king of
Arabia. Several battles, however, were fought, in
all of which the rebels were repulsed and defeated.
They became, therefore, so greatly disheartened, that
at length the commanders resolved every one to
return to their respective countries; and they had
done so, had not Belesis entertained great faith in an
astrological prediction. He was continually consulting
the stars; and at length solemnly assured the
confederated troops, that in five days they would be
aided by a support, they were at present unable to
imagine or anticipate;&mdash;the gods having given to
him a decided intimation of so desirable an interference.
Just as he had predicted, so it happened; for
before the time he mentioned had expired, news
came that the Bactrians, breaking the fetters of servitude,
had sprung into the field, and were hastening
to their assistance.</p>

<p>Sardanapalus, not knowing any thing of the revolt
of the Bactrians, and puffed up by former successes,
was still indulging in sloth and idleness, and preparing
beasts for sacrifice, plenty of wine, and other
things necessary wherewith to feast and entertain his
soldiers. While the army was thus indulging itself,
Arbaces, receiving intelligence, by some deserters, of
the security and intemperance of the enemy, fell in
upon them in the night on a sudden; and being in
due order and discipline, and setting upon such as
were in confusion, he being before prepared, and the
other altogether unprovided, they easily broke into
their camp, and made a great slaughter of some, forcing
the rest into the city. Upon this, Sardanapalus committed
the charge of his whole army to his wife&#8217;s
brother, (Salamenes,) and took upon himself the
defence of the city. But the rebels twice defeated the
king&#8217;s forces; once in the open field, and the second
time before the walls of the city; in which last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
engagement Salamenes was killed, and almost all his
army lost; some being cut off in the pursuit, and
the rest (save a very few) being interrupted, and
prevented from entering into the city, were driven
headlong into the Euphrates; and so great was the
number destroyed, that the river became dyed with
the blood, and retained that colour for a great distance
and a long course together.</p>

<p>Sardanapalus, now perceiving that his kingdom
was like to be lost, sent away his three sons and his
three daughters, with a great deal of treasure, into
Paphlagonia, to Cotta, the governor there, his most
entire friend; and sent posts into all the provinces
of the kingdom, in order to raise soldiers, and to
make all other preparations necessary to endure a
siege; being greatly encouraged to do this from an
acquaintance with an ancient prophecy; viz.&mdash;that
Nineveh could never be taken by force, till the river
should become a foe to the city.</p>

<p>The enemy, on the other hand, grown more courageous
by their successes, eagerly urged on the
siege. They made, nevertheless, but little impression
on the besieged, by reason of the strength of
the walls; for balistæ to cast stones, testudos to
cast up mounts, and battering-rams, were not known
in those ages. The city was also well supplied with
every thing needful. The siege, therefore, lasted
two years: during which time nothing to any purpose
was done, save that the walls were sometimes assaulted,
and the besieged penned up in the city. At
length, in the third year, an unfortunate circumstance
took place. This was no other than the overflowing
of the Euphrates, and from continual rains,
coming up into a part of the city, and tearing down
thirty furlongs of the walls in length.</p>

<p>When the king found this&mdash;conceiving it to be no
other than a fulfilment of the prophecy, on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>improbability
of which he had so strongly relied&mdash;he
gave himself up to despair; caused a large pile of
wood to be made in one of the courts of his palace;
heaped together all his gold, silver, and wearing
apparel; and inclosing his eunuchs and concubines
in an apartment within the pile, caused it to be set on
fire; when all perished in the flames in common with
himself.</p>

<p>When the revolters heard of this, they entered
through several breaches made in the walls, and
took the city. They clothed Arbaces with a royal
robe, proclaimed him king, and invested him with
despotic authority: in gratitude for which Arbaces
rewarded every one according to his deserts. He
showed great clemency, also, to the inhabitants of
Nineveh; for though he dispersed them into several
villages, he restored every one to his estate. He,
nevertheless, razed the city to the ground. The sum,
found in the palace and elsewhere, appears to be
incredible: for it is stated to have been no less than
equivalent to 25,000,000,000 of pounds sterling.
The fire lasted more than fifteen days. Thus, after
a continuance of thirty generations, the Assyrian empire
was overturned, in the year of the world, 3080;
and before Christ 868. Thus far Diodorus; but
Usher, and many other historians, amongst whom
may be mentioned Herodotus, state, that the Assyrian
empire, from Ninus, lasted only 520 years.</p>

<p>Several kings reigned after this, under what is
called the second Assyrian empire. For on the fall
of the former, three considerable kingdoms were
generated, viz:&mdash;that of the Medes, which Arbaces,
on the fall of Nineveh, restored to its liberty; that
of the Assyrians of Babylon, which was given to
Belesis, governor of that city; and that of the Assyrians
of Nineveh.</p>

<p>The first king that reigned in Nineveh, after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
death of Sardanapalus, is called in Scripture Tiglath-Pileser<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>;
the second Salmanaser, in whose reign,
Tobit, with Anna his wife, and his son Tobias, was
carried captive into Assyria, where he became one of
Salmanaser&#8217;s principal officers. That king having
died after a reign of fourteen years, he was succeeded
by his son Sennacherib; he, whose army was cut off
in one night before the walls of Jerusalem. He had
laid siege to that city some time before, but had
marched against Egypt, which country having subdued,
he once more sat down before the sacred city:
&#8220;And it came to pass, that the angel of the Lord
went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a
hundred and four score and five thousand; and when
they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all
dead corpses<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>.&#8221; After so terrible a blow, the pretended
king of kings, as he presumed to call himself,
&#8220;this triumpher over nations, and conqueror of gods,&#8221;
returned to his own country, where &#8220;it came to

that fell upon his army, has been thus described

<p>Esarhaddon was succeeded by Nebuchadnezzar the
First, in whose reign Tobit died<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>. Perceiving his end
approaching, that good old man called his children to
him, and advised them to lose no time, after they
had buried him and their mother, but to quit the city,
before its ruin came on. &#8220;The ruin of Nineveh,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;is at hand; the wickedness of the city will
occasion its ruin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nahum represents the wickedness of this city, too,
in terms exceedingly vivid<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>: &#8220;Woe to the bloody
city! It is all full of lies and robbery.&#8221; &#8220;It shall
come to pass, that all they that look upon thee shall
flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste; who
will bemoan her?&#8221; &#8220;The gates of thy land shall be
set wide open unto thine enemies; the fire shall devour
thy bars.&#8221; &#8220;The sword shall cut thee off; it
shall eat thee up like the canker-worm.&#8221; &#8220;Thy nobles
shall dwell in the dust; thy people be scattered upon
the mountains, and no man shall gather them.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>Zephaniah, also, issued similar denunciations<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a>.
&#8220;The Lord will make Nineveh a desolation, and
dry like a wilderness: and flocks shall lie down in
the midst of her; both the cormorant and the bittern
shall lodge in it; their voice shall sing in the windows;
desolation shall be in the thresholds.&#8221; &#8220;This
is the rejoicing city, that dwelt carelessly, that said
in her heart, &#8216;<i>I am</i>, and there is none beside me.&#8217;
How shall she become a desolation; a place for beasts
to lie down in! every one that passes by shall hiss
and wag his hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ruin, predicted, came in the reign of Saracus.
Cyaxares, king of the Medes, entering into an alliance
with the king of Babylon, they joined their
forces together, laid siege to the city, took it, slew
their king, and utterly destroyed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;God,&#8221; says the historian, &#8220;had foretold by his
prophets, that he would bring vengeance upon that
impious city, for the blood of his servants, wherewith
the kings thereof had gorged themselves, like
ravenous lions; that he himself would march at the
head of the troops that should come to besiege it;
that he would cause consternation and terror to go
before him; that he would deliver the old men, the
mothers, and their children, into the merciless hands
of the soldiers; and that all the treasures of the city
should fall into the hands of rapacious and insatiable
plunderers; and that the city itself should be so
totally destroyed, that not so much as a footstep of
it should be left; and that the people should ask
hereafter, Where did the proud city of Nineveh
stand?&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>This prophecy has been fulfilled only in part; the
absolute completion of it remains still to be fulfilled.
In the time of Hadrian, the ruins of it still existed;
and at a subsequent period a great battle was fought
on the space left among the ruins, between Heraclius,
Emperor of Constantinople, and Rhazates,
general to Chosroes, king of Persia. On that memorable
day, Heraclius, on his horse Phallas, surpassed
the bravest of his warriors; his hip was
wounded with a spear; the steed was wounded in
the thigh; but he carried his master safe and victorious
through the triple phalanx of the enemy. In
the heat of the action, three valiant chiefs were
successively slain by the sword and lance of the
emperor; amongst whom was Rhazates himself.
He fell like a soldier: but the sight of his head
scattered grief and despair through the fainting
ranks of the Persians. In this battle, which was
fiercely fought from day-break to the eleventh hour,
twenty-eight standards, besides those which might
be torn or broken, were taken from the Persians;
the greatest part of their army was cut to pieces,
and the victors, concealing their own loss, passed
the night on the field. They acknowledged that
on this occasion it was less difficult to kill than to
discomfit the soldiers of Chosroes. The conquerors
recovered three hundred Roman standards, as well
as a great number of captives, of Edessa and Alexandria.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Soon after this battle, Chosroes felt compelled
to fly: he was afterwards deposed, thrown
into a dungeon, where he was insulted, famished,
tortured, and at length murdered by one of his
own sons.</p>

<p>We have given an account of its ancient size and
splendour: we must now give some account of the
ruins which still remain: for though some writers
insist, that even the dust of this vast city has disappeared,
it is certain that some of its walls still
subsist, beside the city of Mosul.</p>

<p>Mosul was visited by Captain Kinneir, in the
years 1813-14. &#8220;About a mile before we entered
Mosul,&#8221; says he, &#8220;we passed two artificial tumuli,
and extensive ramparts, supposed to be the ruins of
the ancient Nineveh. The first tumulus is about
three quarters of a mile in circumference. It has
the same appearance, and is of about the same height,
as those we saw at Susa. The circumference of the
other is not so considerable; but its elevation is
greater, and on the top stands the tomb of Jonah,
the prophet, round which has been erected a village,
called Nunia.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Kinneir proceeds to state, that the Jews
go in pilgrimage to this tomb; which is a small
and insignificant building, crowned with a cupola.
The rampart is esteemed, by some, to have been
thrown up by Nadir Shah, when he besieged Mosul.
Captain Kinneir, however, had no doubt that this
opinion is founded in error, since they in no way
resembled the field-works which an army, such as
that of Nadir Shah, was likely to erect. &#8220;I cannot
doubt, therefore,&#8221; says he, &#8220;that they are the vestiges
of some ancient city, probably Nineveh; or
that Larissa, described by Xenophon.&#8221; In regard
to Mosul, he describes it as a sombre-looking town,
fast dwindling into insignificance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>These ruins were subsequently visited by Mr. Rich,
the East India Company&#8217;s resident at Bagdat. They
lie on the eastern banks of the Tigris<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a>. To the
north are the Gara mountains, on the chain of which
snow is said to lie in clefts and sheltered situations
from one year to another. The Tigris is here about
four hundred feet broad, its depth, for the most part,
about two fathoms; and near the bridge was fought
the celebrated battle between Chosroes&#8217; troops and
those of Heraclius, to which we have just now
alluded. On the eastern side of this bridge many
remains of antiquity have been found, consisting, for
the most part, of bricks, some of which are whole
and some in fragments, and pieces of gypsum, some
of which are covered with inscriptions, in cruciform
character<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a>. There are also narrow ancient passages,
with apertures or doors, opening one into the other,
dark, narrow, and vaulted, appearing as if designed
as vaults for the reception of dead bodies.</p>

<p>Mr. Rich afterwards rode through the area of
Nineveh to the first wall of the inclosure. He found
it a line of earth and gravel, out of which large hewn
stones are frequently dug, as out of all the walls of
the area. Beyond was a ditch still very regular;
beyond which was a wall, and beyond that another
wall larger than any. &#8220;The area of Nineveh,&#8221; says
Mr. Rich, &#8220;is, on a rough guess, about one and a
half to two miles broad, and four miles long. On
the river on the west side there are only remains of
one wall; and I observed the same at the north and
south extremities; but on the east side there are the
remains of three walls. The west one appears to
have run a little in front of Nebbi Yunus. Between
it and the river the ground is subject to frequent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>inundations and changes; but it has not interfered
with the area.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Rich did not observe at the angles of the walls
any traces of towers, bastions, or any works of that
kind. These walls are not more than from ten to
fifteen feet high. Large masses of hewn stone are frequently
dug up, and bricks are ploughed up perpetually.
There is also a piece of grey stone, shaped
like the capital of a column, such as at this day surmounts
the wooden pillars or posts of Turkish, or
rather Persian, verandahs; but there was no carving
on it. Pottery, too, is often found, and other Babylonian
fragments; also bits of brick adhering to them.
These are found near a mound, called the Mount of
Koyunjuk, the height of which is about forty-three
feet, and its circumference 7691 feet. Its sides are
very steep, and its top nearly flat.</p>

<p>Some years ago, a very large bas-relief was dug up
among the ruins, representing men and animals,
covering a grey stone about ten or eleven feet in
height. All the town of Mosul left their houses to
go and see this remarkable specimen of antiquity;
but not one had the taste to endeavour to preserve it.
It was in a few days, therefore, cut up or broken to
pieces.</p>

<p>One day, as Mr. Rich was riding along on the outside
of the walls, his attention was directed to an
object of great antiquity. &#8220;Some people had been
digging for stones,&#8221; says he, &#8220;and had dug a hole in
the ground, from which they had turned up many
large hewn stones with bitumen adhering to them.
I examined the excavation, which was about ten
feet deep, and found it consisted of huge stones, laid
in layers of bitumen and lime-mortar. I brought
away some specimens of them sticking together. I
also saw some layers of red clay, which were very
thick, and had become as indurated as burnt brick;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
but there was not the least appearance of reeds or
straw having been used. This mass appeared to
have been a foundation or superstructure. We found
among the rubbish some pieces of coarse unglazed
pottery. It would not have been possible to tell,
from the appearance of the surface of the ground,
that there had been building beneath&mdash;a watercourse
full of pebbles had even passed over it. It is,
therefore, very difficult to say to what extent vestiges
of building may exist outside the inclosures,
the area of which may have been the royal quarter;
but certainly was never sufficient for the city of
Nineveh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Except the ruins of some large and lofty turrets,&#8221;
says Mr. Morier, &#8220;like that of Babel or
Belus, the cities of Babylon and Nineveh are so
completely crumbled into dust, as to be wholly undistinguishable,
but by a few inequalities of the
surface on which they once stood. The humble tent
of the Arab now occupies the spot formerly adorned
with the palaces of kings; and his flocks procure but
a scanty pittance of food, amidst fallen fragments of
ancient magnificence. The banks of the Euphrates and
Tigris, once so prolific, are now, for the most part,
covered with impenetrable brushwood; and the
interior of the province, which was traversed and
fertilised with innumerable canals, is destitute of
either inhabitants or vegetation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Among the ruins is a wall, and on the borders of
that the peasants of the neighbourhood assemble
every year, and sacrifice a sheep, with music and
other festivities; a superstition far anterior to the
religion they now possess. &#8220;One thing is sufficiently
obvious,&#8221; says Mr. Rich, &#8220;to the most
careless observer, and that is, the equality of
age of all the vestiges discovered here. Whether
they belonged to Nineveh or some other city, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
another question; but that they are all of the same
age and character does not admit of a doubt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Rich took measurements of the mounds, that
still exist among these ruins, and did not neglect to
cut her name on the wall of what is called Thisbe&#8217;s
Well. &#8220;Some traveller in after times,&#8221; says he, with
an agreeable enthusiasm, &#8220;when her remembrance
has long been swept away by the torrent of time,
may wonder, on reading the name of Mary Rich<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>, who
the adventurous female was, who had visited the
ruins of Nineveh. He will not be aware, that had
her name been inscribed at every spot she had visited
in the course of her weary pilgrimage, it would be
found in places, compared with which, Mousul is the
centre of civilisation.&#8221;</p>

<p>From the circumstance that from all the mounds
large stones, sometimes with bitumen adhering to
them, are frequently dug out, Mr. Rich was inclined
to believe, that but few bricks were used in the
building of this once vast city. There is, however,
not much certainty as to this, or in regard to what
kind of architecture it was, for the most, or, indeed,
any part constructed; for though its walls may be
traced in a multitude of directions, nothing now
remains beside a few mounds, some bricks, and large
stones, hewn into a shape which evidently prove, that
they once formed the houses or the temples of a city<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>.</p>

<h2>NO. VII.&mdash;NUMANTIA.</h2>

<p>This city stood near the river Douro; out of the
ruins of which has arisen the town of Soria. According
to Strabo, it was the capital of Celtiberia.</p>

<p>Strong by nature and art, and by the number of
its inhabitants, it was built upon a hill, difficult of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>access, and on three sides surrounded by mountains.
Its extent was, also, so great, that it had within its
circuit pasture for cattle. It was unprotected by
walls or towers; yet it bravely maintained itself, for
a considerable time, against the power of the Romans.
The cruelty and injustice of the Romans during this
war is justly stigmatised, as being altogether unworthy
a great and powerful people. The inhabitants
at first gained some advantages over the
Roman forces, till Scipio Africanus was commanded
to finish the war, and to destroy Numantia altogether.
With an army of sixty thousand men he
began the siege. He was opposed by the inhabitants
with great skill and courage, though their force did
not exceed four thousand men. Finding themselves,
however, greatly pressed, the Numantians gave themselves
up,&mdash;first to despair, and then to fury. Their
provisions, too, at length began to fail; and they
were constrained to feed upon the flesh of horses; then
on that of their slain companions; and, lastly, they
drew lots to kill and devour each other. After a multitude
of misfortunes, they signified a desire to capitulate;
but Scipio having demanded, that they should
surrender unconditionally on the next day, the Numantians
refused; and when they obtained a longer
time, instead of surrendering, they retired and set fire
to their houses, and destroyed themselves; so that not
even one remained to grace the triumph of the conqueror.
This, however, has been denied by some
writers, who insist, that a number of Numantines
delivered themselves into the hands of Scipio, and
that fifty of them were drawn in triumph at Rome,
and that the rest were sold as slaves. This occurred
in the year of Rome 629.</p>

<p>Not a vestige remains, but a few traces at a place
called Puente Gavay, a spot difficult of access<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<h2>NO. VIII.&mdash;OLYMPIA.</h2>

<p>This city, known likewise by the name of Pisa,
was situated on the right bank of the Alpheus, at the
foot of an eminence called the Mount of Saturn. It
is peculiarly worthy of attention; since it was near
its walls that the most celebrated games, from the
institution of which all occurrences were dated in
Greece<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a>, were held.</p>

<p>For nearly the whole of what follows, in regard
to the games, we are indebted to Rollin; ours being
an abstract.</p>

<p>There were four kinds of games solemnised in
Greece. The <i>Olympic</i>, so called from <i>Olympia</i>, near
which they were celebrated after the expiration of
every four years, in honour of Jupiter Olympicus.
The <i>Pythic</i>, sacred to Apollo Pythius, also celebrated
every four years. The <i>Nemean</i>, which took
their name from Nemea, a city and forest of Peleponnesus,
instituted by Hercules, solemnised every
two years. And lastly, the <i>Isthmian</i>; celebrated
upon the isthmus of Corinth, from four years to four
years, in honour of Neptune. That persons might
be present at these public sports with greater quiet
and security, there was a general suspension of arms
and cessation of hostilities, throughout all Greece,
during the time of their celebration.</p>

<p>The Greeks thought nothing comparable to a
victory in these games. They looked upon it as the
perfection of glory, and did not believe it permitted
to mortals to desire any thing beyond it. Cicero
assures us, that with them it was no less honourable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>than the consular dignity, in its original splendour
with the ancient Romans.</p>

<p>We shall confine ourselves to the Olympic games,
which continued five days.</p>

<p>The combats, which had the greatest share in
the solemnity of the public games, were boxing,
wrestling, the pancratium, the discus or quoit, and
racing. To these may be added the exercises of
leaping, throwing the dart, and that of the trochus
or wheel; but as these were neither important, nor
of any great reputation, we shall content ourselves
with having only mentioned them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Of the Athletæ, or combatants.</span>&mdash;The term
athletæ was given to those who exercised themselves
with design to dispute the prizes in the public games.
The art, by which they formed themselves for these
encounters, was called gymnastic, from the athletæ&#8217;s
practising naked.</p>

<p>Those who were designed for this profession frequented,
from their most tender age, the gymnasia
or palæstræ, which were a kind of academies maintained
for that purpose at the public expense. In
these places, such young people were under the direction
of different masters, who employed the most
effectual methods to inure their bodies for the fatigues
of the public games, and to form them for the combats.
The regimen they were under was very severe.
At first they had no other nourishment but dried figs,
nuts, soft cheese, and a gross heavy sort of bread.
They were absolutely forbid the use of wine, and
enjoined continence.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Who, in the Olympic race, the prize would gain,</span>
<span class="i0">Has borne from early youth fatigue and pain,</span>
<span class="i0">Excess of heat and cold has often tried,</span>
<span class="i0">Love&#8217;s softness banish&#8217;d, and the glass denied.</span>
</div></div>

<p>The athletæ, before their exercises, were rubbed
with oils and ointments, to make their bodies more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
supple and vigorous. At first they made use of a
belt, with an apron or scarf fastened to it, for their
more decent appearance in the combats; but one of
the combatants happening to lose the victory by this
covering&#8217;s falling off, that accident was the occasion
of sacrificing modesty to convenience, and retrenching
the apron for the future. The athletæ were only
naked in some exercises, as wrestling, boxing, the
pancratium, and the foot-race.</p>

<p>It was necessary that their morals should be
unexceptionable, and their condition free. No stranger
was admitted to combat in the Olympic games; and
when Alexander, the son of Amyntas, king of Macedon,
presented himself to dispute the prize, his
competitors, without any regard to the royal dignity,
opposed his reception as a Macedonian, and consequently
a barbarian and a stranger; nor could the
judge be prevailed upon to admit him till he had
proved, in due form, that his family was originally
descended from the Argives.</p>

<p>They were made to take an oath, that they would
religiously observe the several laws prescribed in
each kind of combat, and do nothing contrary to the
established orders and regulations of the games.
Fraud, artifice, and excessive violence, were absolutely
prohibited; and the maxim so generally received
elsewhere, that it is indifferent whether an
enemy is conquered by deceit or valour, was banished
from these combats.</p>

<p>It is time to bring our champions to blows, and
to run over the different kinds of combats in which
they exercised themselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wrestling</span> is one of the most ancient exercises of
which we have any knowledge, having been practised
in the time of the patriarchs, as the wrestling of the
angel with Jacob proves<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>
<p>Wrestling among the Greeks, as well as other
nations, was practised at first with simplicity, little
art, and in a natural manner; the weight of the
body, and the strength of the muscles, having more
share of it, than address or skill.</p>

<p>The wrestlers, before they began their combats,
were rubbed all over in a rough manner, and afterwards
anointed with oils, which added to the strength
and flexibility of their limbs. But as this unction,
in making the skin too slippery, rendered it difficult
for them to take hold of each other, they remedied
that inconvenience, sometimes by rolling themselves
in the dust of the palæstræ, sometimes by throwing
a fine sand upon each other, kept for that purpose in
the porticoes of the gymnasia.</p>

<p>Thus prepared, the wrestlers began their combat.
They were matched two against two, and sometimes
several couples contended at the same time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Of Boxing, or the Cestus.</span>&mdash;The combatants
covered their fists with a kind of offensive arms called
<i>cestus</i>, and their heads with a sort of leather cap, to
defend their temples and ears, which were most
exposed to blows, and to deaden their violence. The
cestus was a kind of gauntlet or glove, made of
straps of leather, and plated with brass, lead, or iron,
inside. Their use was to strengthen the hands of the
combatants, and to add violence to their blows.</p>

<p>Boxing was one of the rudest and most dangerous
of the gymnastic combats; because, besides the danger
of being crippled, the combatants ran the hazard of
losing their lives. They sometimes fell down dead, or
dying, upon the sand; though that seldom happened,
except the vanquished person persisted too long
in not acknowledging his defeat: yet it was common
for them to quit the fight with a countenance so disfigured,
that it was not easy to know them afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Of the Pancratium.</span>&mdash;The Pancratium was so
called from two Greek words<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> which signify that the
whole force of the body was necessary for succeeding
in it. It united boxing and wrestling in the same
fight, borrowing from one its manner of struggling
and throwing, and from the other, the art of dealing
blows, and of avoiding them with success.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Of the Discus, or quoit.</span>&mdash;The discus was a
kind of quoit of a round form, made sometimes of
wood, but more frequently of stone, lead, or other
metal, as iron or brass. Those who used this exercise
were called Discoboli; that is, flingers of the discus.</p>

<p>The athletæ, in hurling the discus, put themselves
into the best posture they could, to add force to their
cast. He that flung the discus farthest was the victor.</p>

<p>The most famous painters and sculptors of antiquity,
in their endeavours to represent naturally the attitudes
of the discoboli, have left posterity many masterpieces
in their several arts. Quintilian exceedingly
extols a statue of this kind, which had been finished
with infinite care and application by the celebrated
Myron<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Of the Pentathlum.</span>&mdash;The Greeks gave this
name to an exercise composed of five others:&mdash;wrestling,
running, leaping, throwing the dart, and
the discus. It is believed that this sort of combat
was decided in one day, and sometimes the same
morning; and that the prize, which was single, could
not be given but to the victor in all those exercises.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Of Races.</span>&mdash;Of all the exercises which the athletæ
cultivated with so much pains and industry, for their
appearance in the public games, running was in the
highest estimation, and held the foremost rank.</p>

<p>The place where the athletæ exercised themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>in running, was generally called the <i>Stadium</i> by the
Greeks; as was that wherein they disputed in earnest
for the prize. Under that denomination was included
not only the space in which the athletæ ran, but also
that which contained the spectators of the gymnastic
games.</p>

<p>The middle of the Stadium was remarkable only
by the circumstance of having the prizes allotted to
the victors set up there. St. Chrysostom draws a
fine comparison from this custom. &#8220;As the judges,&#8221;
says he, &#8220;in the races and other games, expose in the
midst of the Stadium, to the view of the champions,
the crowns which they are to receive; in like manner
the Lord, by the mouth of his prophets, has placed
the prizes in the midst of the course, which he designs
for those who have the courage to contend for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were three kinds of races, the chariot, the
horse, and the foot-race.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Of the Foot-race.</span>&mdash;The runners, of whatever
number they were, ranged themselves in a line, after
having drawn lots for their places. Whilst they
waited the signal to start, they practised, by way of
prelude, various motions to awaken their activity,
and to keep their limbs pliable and in a right temper.
They kept themselves breathing by small leaps, and
making little excursions, which were a kind of trial
of their speed and agility. Upon the signal&#8217;s being
given, they flew towards the goal, with a rapidity
scarcely to be followed by the eye, which was solely to
decide the victory; for the Agnostic laws prohibited,
upon the penalty of infamy, the attaining it by any
foul method.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Of the Horse-races.</span>&mdash;The race of a single
horse with a rider was less celebrated by the ancients;
yet it had its favourers amongst the most considerable
persons, even kings themselves, and was attended with
uncommon glory to the victor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Of the Chariot-races.</span>&mdash;This kind of race
was the most renowned of all the exercises used in
the games of the ancients, and that from whence
most honour redounded to the victors. It is plain
they were derived from the constant custom of princes,
heroes and great men, of fighting in battle upon
chariots. Homer has an infinity of examples of this
kind. All those, who presented themselves in the
Olympic games to dispute the prize in the chariot
races, were persons considerable either for their riches,
their birth, their employments, or great actions.
Kings themselves aspired passionately to this glory,
from the belief that the title of victor in these games
was scarcely inferior to that of conqueror, and that the
Olympic palm added new dignity to the splendours
of a throne.</p>

<p>The chariots were generally drawn by two or
four horses. Sometimes mules supplied the place
of horses. These chariots, upon a signal given,
started together. Their places were regulated by
lot, which was not an indifferent circumstance as
to the victory; for being to turn round a boundary,
the chariot on the left was nearer than those on the
right, which in consequence had a greater compass to
take. They ran twelve times round the Stadium.
He that came in first the twelfth round was victor.
The chief art consisted in taking the best ground at
the turning of the boundary; for if the charioteer
drove too near it, he was in danger of dashing the
chariot to pieces; and if he kept too wide of it, his
nearest antagonist might get foremost.</p>

<p>To avoid such danger, Nestor gave the following
directions to his son Antilochus, who was going to
dispute the prize in the chariot races. &#8220;My son,&#8221;
says he, &#8220;drive your horses as near as possible to the
turning; for which reason, always inclining your body
over your chariot, get the left of your competitors; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
encouraging the horse on the right, give him the rein,
whilst the near-horse, hard held, turns the boundary
so close to it, that the nave of the wheel seems to
graze upon it; but have a care of running against
the stone, lest you wound your horses, and dash the
chariot in pieces.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not required, that those who disputed
the victory should enter the lists, and drive their
chariots in person. Their being spectators of the
games, or sending their horses thither, was sufficient.</p>

<p>No one ever carried the ambition of making a
great figure in the public games of Greece so far as
Alcibiades, in which he distinguished himself in the
most splendid manner, by the great number of horses
and chariots, which he kept only for the races. It is
not easy to comprehend, how the wealth of a private
person should suffice to so enormous an expense:
but Antisthenes, the scholar of Socrates, who relates
what he saw, informs us, that many cities of the
allies, in a kind of emulation with each other, supplied
Alcibiades with all things necessary for the
support of such magnificence. Equipages, horses,
tents, sacrifices, the most exquisite provisions, the
most delicate wines; in a word, all that was necessary
to the support of his table or train.</p>

<p>We must not omit, in speaking of the Olympic
games, to notice that ladies were admitted to dispute
the prize in them as well as the men, which many of
them obtained. Cynisca, sister of Agesilaus, king
of Sparta, first opened this new path of glory to
her sex, and was proclaimed victrix in the race of
chariots with four horses. This victory, which till
then had no example, did not fail of being celebrated
with all possible splendour.&mdash;A magnificent monument
was erected in Sparta in honour of Cynisca;
and the Lacedæmonians, though otherwise very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
little sensible to the charms of poetry, appointed
a poet to transmit this new triumph to posterity,
and to immortalize its memory by an inscription in
verse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Of the honours and rewards granted to
the victors.</span>&mdash;These honours and rewards were
of several kinds. The spectators&#8217; acclamations in
honour of the victors were only a prelude to the
rewards designed them. These rewards were different
wreaths of wild olive, pine, parsley, or laurel,
according to the different places where the games
were celebrated. Those crowns were always attended
with branches of palm, that the victors carried
in their right hands. As he might be victor more
than once in the same games, and sometimes on the
same day, he might also receive several crowns and
palms.</p>

<p>When the victor had received the crown and
palm, a herald, preceded by a trumpeter, conducted
him through the Stadium, and proclaimed aloud his
name and country.</p>

<p>When he returned to his own country, the people
came out in a body to meet him, and conducted
him into the city, adorned with all the marks of his
victory, and riding upon a chariot drawn by four
horses. He made his entry not through the gates,
but through a breach purposely made in the walls.
Lighted torches were carried before him, and a
numerous train followed, to do honour to the procession.</p>

<p>One of the most honourable privileges granted
to the athletic victors, was the right of taking place
at the public games. At Sparta it was a custom
for the king to take them with him in military expeditions,
to fight near his person, and to be his
guard; which, with reason, was judged very honourable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
Another privilege, in which the useful united
with the honourable, was that of being maintained
for the rest of their lives at the expense of their
country. They were also exempted from all civil
offices and employments.</p>

<p>The praises of the victorious athlete were,
amongst the Greeks, one of the principal subjects
of their lyric poetry. We find, that all the odes
of the four books of Pindar turn upon it, each of
which takes its title from the games, in which the
combatants signalised themselves, whose victories
those poems celebrate.</p>

<p>Sculpture united with poetry to perpetuate the
fame of the champions. Statues were erected to
the victors, in the very place where they had been
crowned, and sometimes in that of their birth also,
which was commonly done at the expense of their
country. Amongst the statues which adorned Olympia,
were those of several children of ten or twelve
years old, who had obtained the prize at that age in
the Olympic games. They did not only raise such
monuments to the champions, but to the very horses
to whose swiftness they were indebted for the Agonistic
crown: and Pausanias mentions one, which
was erected in honour of a mare, called Aura, whose
history is worth repeating. Phidolas, her rider,
having fallen off in the beginning of the race, the
mare continued to run in the same manner as if he
had been upon her back. She outstripped all the
rest, and upon the sound of the trumpets, which
was usual toward the end of the race to animate the
competitors, she redoubled her vigour and courage,
turned round the goal, and, as if she had been sensible
of the victory, presented herself before the judges
of the games.</p>

<p>Nor did the entertainments finish here. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
was another kind of competition; and that, too,
which does not at all depend upon the strength, activity,
and address of the body, and may be called,
with reason, the combat of the mind; wherein the
orators, historians, and poets, made trial of their
capacities, and submitted their productions to the
judgment of the public.</p>

<p>It was a great honour, and, at the same time,
a most sensible pleasure for writers, who are generally
fond of fame and applause, to have known how
to reconcile the voices in their favour of so numerous
and select an assembly as that of the Olympic
games, in which were present all the finest geniuses
of Greece, and all the best judges of the excellence
of a work. This theatre was equally open to history,
eloquence, and poetry.</p>

<p>Herodotus read his history in the Olympic
games to all Greece, assembled at them, and was
heard with such applause, that the names of the
nine Muses were given to the nine books which
compose his work, and the people cried out wherever
he passed, &#8220;That is he, who has written our history,
and celebrated our glorious successes against the
Barbarians.&#8221;</p>

<p>Anciently, Olympia was surrounded by walls; it
had two temples,&mdash;one dedicated to Jupiter, and
another to Juno; a senate-house, a theatre, and
many other beautiful edifices, and also an innumerable
multitude of statues.</p>

<p>The temple of Jupiter was built with the spoils,
taken from certain states which had revolted; it was
of the Doric order; sixty-eight feet high, two
hundred and thirty long, and ninety-five broad.
This edifice was built by an able architect, named
Libon; and it was adorned by two sculptors of equal
skill, who enriched the pediments of the principal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
front with elaborate and elegant ornaments. The statue
of the god, the work of Phidias, was of gold
and ivory, fifty cubits high. On the one pediment,
[Oe]nomaus and Peleus were disputing the prize of the
race in the presence of Jupiter; on the other was
the battle of the Centaurs and the Lapithæ. On the
summit of each pediment was a Victory, of gilt
brass; and at each angle a large vase of the same
metal.</p>

<p>This statue was the finest the world ever saw.
&#8220;Indeed,&#8221; says Mr. Dodwell; and he is borne out
by the authorities of all those ancient writers who
have written of it, &#8220;it appears to have united all
the beauty of form, and all the splendour of effect,
that are produced by the highest excellence of the
statuary and the painter.&#8221;</p>

<p>The altar in this temple<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> was composed of ashes
from the thighs of the victims, which were carried
up and consumed on the top with wood of the white
poplar-tree. The ashes, also, of the Prytanæum, in
which a perpetual fire was kept on a hearth, were
removed annually, on a fixed day, and spread on it,
being first mingled with water from the Alpheus.
The people of Elis sacrificed daily, and private
persons as often as they chose.</p>

<p>Olympia<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> preserved, much longer than Delphi,
and with less diminution, the sacred property, of
which it was a similar repository. Some images
were removed by Tiberius Nero. His successor,
Caius Caligula, who honoured Jupiter with the
familiar appellation of brother, commanded that his
image should be transported to Rome; but the architects
declared it was impossible, without destroying
the work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>The god, in the time of Pausanias, retained his
original splendour. The native offerings of crowns
and chariots, and of charioteers, and horses, and
oxen, in brass, the precious images of gold, ivory,
or amber, and the curiosities consecrated in the
temples, the treasuries, and other edifices, could
not be viewed without astonishment. The number
of statues within the grove, was itself an amazing
spectacle. Many were the works of Myron, Lysippus,
and the prime artists of Greece. Here kings
and emperors were assembled; and Jupiter towered
in brass from twelve to thirty feet high! Let the
reader peruse the detail given by Pausanias, and
imagine, if he can, the entertainment which Olympia
must then have afforded to the antiquary, the connoisseur,
and historian.</p>

<p>Of all splendour, the temple of Juno alone can
be ascertained with any degree of certainty. The
soil, which has been considerably elevated, covers
the greater part of the ruin. The walls of the
cella rise only two feet from the ground. &#8220;We
employed,&#8221; says Mr. Dodwell, &#8220;some Turks to
excavate; and we discovered some frusta of the
Doric order, of which the flutings were thirteen
inches wide, and the diameter of the whole column
seven feet three inches. We found, also, part of a
small column of Parian marble, which the intervals
of the flutings show to have been of the Ionic or
the Corinthian order. The work of ruin, however,
is constantly going on; and lately the people of
Lalla (a town in the neighbourhood) have even
rooted up some of the foundations of this once
celebrated sanctuary, in order to use the materials
in the construction of their houses<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a>&#8221;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<h2>NO. IX.&mdash;PUTEOLI.</h2>

<p>A maritime city of Campania, between Baiæ and
Naples. It was founded by a colony from Cumæ.
It was, in the first instance, called Dicæarchia,
(&#8220;Just Power<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a>,&#8221;) and afterwards Puteoli, from the
great number of wells that were in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>It was delightfully situated on a point projecting
into the sea, nearly in the centre of the bay of Puzzuoli.
It was the sea-port of the inhabitants of
Cannæ; and a rendezvous for merchants from Greece,
Sicily, and all parts of Italy. The attractions of the
town, also, on account of its hot baths and mineral
waters, allured the more opulent citizens of Rome to
its vicinity.</p>

<p>In the square of the town stands a beautiful
marble pedestal, covered with bas-reliefs, representing
the fourteen towns of Asia Minor, destroyed by
an earthquake, and rebuilt by Tiberius. It supported
a statue of that emperor, erected by the same cities
as a monument of gratitude. The cathedral stands
on the ruins of a temple, and is built chiefly of
ancient materials.</p>

<p>A temple of Serapis offers many subjects of observation.
Half of its buildings, however, are still
buried under the earth thrown upon it by volcanic
commotions, or accumulated by the windings of the
hill. The inclosure is square, environed by buildings
for priests, and baths for votaries; in the centre remains
a circular platform, with four flights of steps
up to it; vases for fire, a central altar, rings for victims,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
and other appendages of sacrifice, entire and
not displaced; but the columns that held its roof
have been removed to the new palace of Caserta.
The temple itself was not discovered till <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 1750,
on the removal of some rubbish and bushes, which
had, till then, partly concealed it from observation.</p>

<p>Behind this place of worship, stand three pillars
without capitals, part of the pronaos of a large
temple. These are of Cipoline marble, and at the
middle of their height, are full of holes eaten in
them by the file-fish<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of Puteoli are many relics
of ancient grandeur, of which none deserves more
attention than the Campanian Way, paved with lava,
and lined on each side with venerable tombs, the
repositories of the dead, which are richly adorned
with stucco in the inside. This road was made in
the most solid, expensive manner, by order of Domitian,
and is frequently the subject of encomium in
the poems of Statius.</p>

<p>One of the most striking monuments of the city
is the remains of the mole that formed the ancient
part. Several of its piers still stand unbroken; they
are sunk in the water, and once supported arches
(to the number of twenty-five,) part of which remain
above the water.</p>

<p>At the end of this mole began the bridge of Caligula,
which extended across part of the bay to
Baiæ, no less than half a mile in length in a straight
line. This structure has long since been swept
away.</p>

<p>On the hill behind the town are the remains of an
amphitheatre, called, after that at Rome, the Coliseum.
It was of considerable magnitude.  The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>gates, and a large portion of the vault and under
apartments, remain. One of these apartments, or
rather dungeons, in which St. Januarius, the patron
saint of Naples, was confined, is now turned into a
damp and gloomy chapel; the arena is a garden;
vines, fig-trees, and pomegranates, have gradually
crept up the circumference, and now cover the slope,
and run over the ruin<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a>.</p>

<p>It is easy to guess what the animation and splendour
of Puteoli must have been, at the time when
the riches of the East were poured into its bosom;
and when its climate, wit, and beauty, allured the
most opulent Romans to its vicinity.</p>

<p>Cicero had a marine villa here, called Puteolanum.
Pliny relates that it was on the shore, and adorned
with a portico, which seems to have been remarkable
for its beauty. He adds that Cicero erected here a
monument, and that, shortly after his death, a
fountain of warm water, very wholesome for the
eyes, burst forth, and gave occasion to an epigram,
which the philosopher quotes with applause<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a>. The
portico is fallen, the groves are withered, the fountain
dried up, and not a vestige of the retreat
left behind to mark its situation. The verses
remain, and perpetuate the glory of the orator, the
fame of the fountain, the beauty of the villa, and
what is more honourable than all united, the gratitude
of Cicero&#8217;s freed-man, Tullius.</p>

<p>St. Paul landed here in his way from Rhegium
to Rome; and found Christians even in that early
age. In the museum of Portici is a picture
presenting a view of ancient Puteoli, supposed to
have been painted before St. Paul landed there.
&#8220;The picture,&#8221; says Mr. Williams, &#8220;is of course very
different from the present state of the city; but still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>a likeness may be traced, if we keep in view the site
of the various temples, and other objects, the foundations
of which are still visible.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the sea shore, near Puzzuoli, are also found
seals, coins, cornelians, and agates; bearing impressions
of corn, grapes, and vine-branches, ants, eagles,
and other animals. These are thrown up by the
waves, after violent storms; and commemorate the
magnificence of a city, now forming part of the Mediterranean
bed<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>.</p>

<h2>NO. X.&mdash;PALMYRA. (TADMOR.)</h2>

<p class="small">&#8220;As patience is the greatest of friends to the unfortunate, so is
time the greatest of friends to the lovers of landscape. It resolves
the noblest works of art into the most affecting ornaments of created
things. The fall of empires, with which the death of great characters
is so immediately associated, possesses a prescriptive title, as
it were, to all our sympathy; forming at once a magnificent, yet
melancholy spectacle; and awakening in the mind all the grandeur
of solitude. Who would not be delighted to make a pilgrimage to
the East to see the columns of Persepolis, and the still more magnificent
ruins of Palmyra? Where awe springs, as it were, personified
from the fragments, and proclaims instructive lessons from
the vicissitudes of fortune. Palmyra, once a paradise in the centre
of inhospitable deserts, the pride of Solomon, the capital of Zenobia,
and the wonder and admiration of all the East, now lies &#8216;majestic
though in ruins!&#8217; Its glory withered, time has cast over it a sacred
grandeur, softened into grace. History, by its silence, mourns
its melancholy destiny; while immense masses and stupendous
columns denote the spot, where once the splendid city of the desert
reared her proud and matchless towers. Ruins are the only legacy
the destroyer left to posterity.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Harmonies of Nature.</span></p>

<p>This city was the capital of Palmyrene, a country on
the eastern boundaries of Syria. Its origin is uncertain;
but a portion of its history is exceedingly interesting;
and its vast assemblage of ruins are beheld
with astonishment and rapture by the curious, the
learned, and the elegant.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-065a.jpg" width="500" height="310" alt="Palmyra" title="" />
<div class="caption">PALMYRA</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>It was situated in the midst of a large plain, surrounded
on three sides by a long chain of mountains.
It stands in a desert, in the pachalic of Damascus,
about forty-eight leagues from Aleppo, and about
the same distance from Damascus, eighty-five miles
west from the Euphrates, and about one hundred and
seventeen from the shores of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>History is, for the most part, silent in regard to
the early history of this city. It is said to have been
built by Solomon, after he had conquered the king of
Hamathzoba, within whose dominion the country
lay, in which the city was afterwards erected. He
called it Tadmor<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>, which some have construed as
the place of Palms<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>; and sometimes &#8220;Tadmor in
the Wilderness.&#8221;</p>

<p>We are assured by Josephus, that this was the
city which the Greeks and Romans afterwards called
Palmyra. His words are:&mdash;&#8220;Now, Solomon went
in the desert above Syria, and possessed himself
of it; and built there a very great city, which was
distant two days&#8217; journey from the upper Syria,
and one day&#8217;s journey from the Euphrates, and six
long days&#8217; journey from Babylon the great. Now
the reason why this city lay so remote from those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>parts of Syria, that are inhabited, is this: that below
there is no water to be had; and that it is in that
place only that there are springs and pits of water.
When, therefore, he had built that city, and encompassed
it with very strong walls, he gave it the name
of Tadmor; and that is the name it is still called by
at this day among the Syrians<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a>: but the Greeks
name it Palmyra.&#8221;</p>

<p>That the city was built by Solomon is most probable;
but that the present ruins have any relation to
buildings of his erection is very improbable: indeed we
must assume it as certain that they are not; they being
entirely those of the Greek orders. With the exception
of four Ionic half-columns in the Temple of the
Sun, and two in one of the mausoleums, the whole
architecture of Palmyra is Corinthian. Neither history
nor even tradition, moreover, speaks of any other
architect than Solomon.</p>

<p>Some have been disposed to give it an earlier
existence<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a>. The Arabic translator of Chronicles
makes Palmyra older than Solomon; John of Antioch,
surnamed Melala, says, that he built it on the
spot where David slew Goliah, in memory of that
action; and Abul-Farai mentions in what year, with
the particulars. These and other accounts of the early
state of Palmyra, which might be collected from the
Arabic authors, bear such evident marks of fable and
wild conjecture, that we shall pass them over.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this, we assume the city to have
been founded by the celebrated king to whom the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>honour is given: who built the temples is totally
unknown.</p>

<p>The motives which tempted Solomon to build a
city in a plain, now altogether a desert, we copy
from Mr. Addison&#8217;s Travels to Damascus:&mdash;&#8220;The
astonishment that takes hold of the mind at the
strange position of this magnificent city, at one
time the capital of the East, on the edge of the
great desert, and surrounded for several days&#8217; journey
on all sides by naked solitary wilds, is removed
by marking well the peculiarity of its geographical
position. The great caravans coming to Europe,
laden with the rich merchandise of India, would naturally
come along the Persian gulf, through the
south of Persia, to the Euphrates, the direct line;
their object then would be to strike across the great
Syrian desert as early as possible, to reach the large
markets and ports of Syria. With more than 600
miles of desert without water, between the mouth of
the Euphrates and Syria, they would naturally be
obliged to keep along the banks of that river, until
the extent of desert country became diminished. They
would then find the copious springs of Tadmor the
nearest and most convenient to make for; and in
their direct route from the north of India along the
Euphrates. These springs would then immediately
become most important, and would naturally attract
the attention of a wise prince like Solomon, who
would &#8216;fence them with strong walls.&#8217; Here the
caravans would rest and take in water; here would
congregate the merchants from adjacent countries and
Europe; and from hence the great caravan would be
divided into numerous branches, to the north, south,
and west<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>. A large mart for the exchange of commodities
would be established, and an important city
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>would quickly arise. The choice of this spot by
Solomon, we may naturally consider founded on a
policy of enriching himself by drawing the commerce
of India through his dominions, from which commerce,
probably, he derived the wealth for which he
is so celebrated. In the chapter, succeeding that in
which Solomon is mentioned to have built Tadmor in
the wilderness, we read that &#8216;the weight of gold that
came to Solomon in one year, was six hundred three
score and six talents of gold<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a>; besides that he had
of the merchantmen, and of the traffic of the spice-merchants,
and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the
governors of the country.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The city which Solomon built was destroyed by
Nebuchadnezzar; but who rebuilt it is entirely unknown.
It is not mentioned by Xenophon, in his
history of the expedition of Cyrus the younger,
though he gives a very accurate account of the desert,
and must have left this place not a great way to the
right in his march towards Babylon. Nor is it once
alluded to by Diodorus, nor Plutarch, nor Arrian,
nor Quintus Curtius, nor, indeed, by any of the
biographers or historians of Alexander; although he
marched through this desert to Thapsacus.</p>

<p>Nor is it taken any notice of as being in existence
even in the time of Seleucus Nicator, he who built
so many cities in Syria; nor is it once mentioned in
the history of his successor. It is not even mentioned
so lately as the time in which Pompey the
Great conquered the country in which it is situated.
No notice is taken in Roman history of its being in
any way existing, till the time of Mark Antony;
who, after the battle at Philippi, marched against it,
as we are told by Appian, with a view of plundering
it; but the inhabitants escaped with their effects
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>over the Euphrates. This very circumstance proves
it to have been at that time no very large place;
added to which, it seems to be certain, that none of
these temples, &amp;c., could have been in existence; for
the Romans had, for some time, been alive to the
benefits of works of art; especially paintings, sculpture,
and architecture. His sole object, in going
thither, was to plunder the Palmyrene merchants, who
were supposed to have acquired considerable wealth,
by selling the commodities of India and Arabia.</p>

<p>Added to all this, Strabo, the best and most accurate
geographer of ancient times, does not once speak
of its name. The first description of this now celebrated
place is by Pliny; and it runs thus:&mdash;&#8220;Palmyra
is remarkable for situation, a rich soil, and
pleasant streams. It is surrounded on all sides by a
vast sandy desert, which totally separates it from the
rest of the world, and has preserved its independence
between the two great empires of Rome and Parthia,
whose first care, when at war, is to engage it in their
interest. It is distant from Seleucia three hundred
and thirty-seven miles; from the Mediterranean two
hundred and three; and from Damascus one hundred
and seventy-six.&#8221;</p>

<p>These distances are not quite accurate, being too
great. Palmyra is also mentioned by Ptolemy, who
makes it the capital of sixteen cities in Syria Palmyrena.
Trajan and Hadrian made expeditions into the
East, and must have passed through this city, or near
it. Nothing, however, is said of it. Had the temples
been there at that time, Hadrian, who was so
great a patron of the elegant arts, would, there can
be no doubt, have valued them. Some, indeed, insist
that he repaired the city; and that it was thence
called Hadrianopolis.</p>

<p>The Palmyrenes submitted to that emperor about
the year 130. Hadrian, then, making a tour through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Syria into Egypt, delighted with the situation and
native strength of the place, is said to have determined
on furnishing it with various splendid edifices
and ornaments; and it is probable, that he then conferred
upon it the privileges of &#8220;Colonia Juris
Italici,&#8221; which, as we learn from Ulpian, it actually
enjoyed, and the inhabitants were thence induced by
gratitude to call themselves &#8220;Hadrianopolitæ.&#8221; It
is supposed that many of its marble pillars, particularly
those of the long porticoes, were the gift of this
emperor. It must, nevertheless, be borne in mind,
that all this is little better than conjecture. Mr.
Halifax, however, says, &#8220;that as the most ancient inscription,
he met with at Palmyra, was dated the three
hundred and fourteenth year from the death of Alexander,
that is, ten years before Christ, and another,
dated between twenty and thirty years before Hadrian,
consequently before the Romans got footing there, he
concluded, that the sumptuous structures he saw
there were not raised by the Romans.&#8221;</p>

<p>From an inscription on the shaft of a column in
the long portico, where all the inscriptions seem to
have been under statues, it appears that, in the reign
of Alexander Severus, they joined that emperor in
his expedition against the Persians.</p>

<p>From this time to the reign of Gallienus, no mention
is made of this city: but then it became so conspicuous,
that its history will be a subject of interest
to all succeeding times.</p>

<p>The following is an abstract of the history of this
period, presented to us in the pages of Gibbon, Mr.
Wood, and other writers. A place possessed of
such singular advantages, and situated at a convenient
distance from the gulf of Persia, and the
Mediterranean, was soon frequented by the caravans,
which conveyed to the nations of Europe a considerable
part of the rich commodities of India. Palmyra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
insensibly increased into an opulent and independent
city; and, connecting the Roman and Parthian
empire by the mutual benefits of commerce, was
suffered to observe an humble neutrality; till at length,
after the victories of Trajan, the little republic sank
into the bosom of Rome, and flourished more than
one hundred and fifty years in the subordinate yet
honourable rank of a colony; and it is during this
period of peace, Mr. Gibbon is disposed to believe,
that the wealthy Palmyrians constructed those
temples, palaces and porticoes of Grecian architecture,
the ruins of which in modern times have excited so
much admiration and wonder.</p>

<p>The Roman affairs in the East had been for some
time in a very deplorable condition, when Odenatus,
a Palmyrene, but of what family or rank originally
in the state is not agreed<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a>, made so judicious a use
of his situation between the two rival powers of
Rome and Persia, as to succeed in getting the balance
of power into his hands. It appears, that he declared
in favour of different interests, as alterations of affairs
rendered necessary. At length he joined the shattered
remains of the Roman army in Syria, routed Sapor,
the Persian king, and advanced as far as Ctesiphon,
the capital of his empire. He returned from this
expedition in great glory; and hence Gallienus,
emperor of Rome, was induced to declare him
Augustus and co-partner of his empire.</p>

<p>This elevation,&mdash;which he enjoyed jointly with his
celebrated consort, Zenobia,&mdash;appeared to reflect a new
splendour on their country, and Palmyra for a while
stood upon an equality with Rome. The competition,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>however, was fatal; and ages of prosperity were
sacrificed to a moment of glory.</p>

<p>The last public action of Odenatus was his relieving
Asia from the Goths, who had over-run
several of its provinces, committing great ravages;
but retired upon his approach: in pursuing them, however,
Odenatus was assassinated by an officer of his own
guard, named Mæonius, who was also his kinsman;
and who, having taken the son off also, became for a
short time sovereign. He, too, shared the fate of
those he had betrayed, and Zenobia became sovereign
queen in his stead.</p>

<p>All that is known of Zenobia&#8217;s extraction is, that
she claimed a descent from the Ptolemies of Egypt<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a>;
and that she boasted of having Cleopatra for an ancestress.
She was a woman of very great beauty<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a>; and
of very extraordinary enterprise. We cannot enter
into her history so fully as we could wish. She
conquered Syria and Mesopotamia; she subdued
Egypt; and added the greater part of Asia Minor to
her dominions. Thus a small territory in the desert,
under the government of a woman, made the great
kingdoms of the Ptolemies and the Seleucidæ part of
the dominions of a single city, whose name we look
in vain for in their history; and Zenobia, lately confined
to the barren plain of Palmyra, ruled from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>south of Egypt to the Bosphorus and the Black
Sea.</p>

<p>At length Aurelian, the Roman emperor, entered
the field against her; and the loss of two great battles,
the former near Antioch, the latter at Emesa, reduced
her to the necessity of taking shelter within the walls
of her own capital. Aurelian besieged her there;
but the enterprise was exceedingly difficult. &#8220;The
Roman people,&#8221; said Aurelian, &#8220;speak with contempt
of the war, which I am waging against a
woman. They are ignorant both of the character
and power of Zenobia. It is impossible to enumerate
her warlike preparations, of stones, of arrows, and of
every species of missile weapons. Every part of the
walls is provided with two or three balistæ<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a>, and
artificial fires are thrown from her military engines.
The fear of punishment has armed her with a desperate
courage. Yet I still trust to the protecting deities
of Rome, who have hitherto been favourable to all
my undertakings.&#8221;</p>

<p>In another letter he writes to the senate in the
following terms:&mdash;&#8220;I hear, Conscript Fathers, that it
hath been urged against me, that I have not accomplished
a manly task, in not triumphing over Zenobia.
But my very blamers themselves would not know how
to praise me enough, if they knew that woman; her
firmness of purpose; the dignity she preserves towards
her army; her munificence when circumstances
require it; her severity, when to be severe is to be
just. I may say, that the victory of Odenatus over
the Persians, and his putting Sapor to flight, and his
reaching Ctesiphon, were due to her. I can assert
that such was the dread entertained of this woman
among the nations of the East and of Egypt, that she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>kept in check the Arabians, the Saracens, and the
Armenians; nor would I have preserved her life, if
I had not thought she would much benefit the Roman
state.&#8221; This was written after her defeat.</p>

<p>Tired of making unsuccessful attempts, Aurelian
determined to try the effects of negotiation, and
accordingly wrote to Zenobia. The style he adopted,
however, rather commanded terms than proposed
them:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Aurelian, emperor of the Roman world, to
Zenobia, and the others united together in hostile
alliance.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to do that of your own accord, which
is commanded by my letters. I charge you to surrender,
on your lives being spared; and you, Zenobia,
may pass your life in some spot where I shall place
you, in pursuance of the distinguished sentence of
the senate; your gems, silver, gold, silk, horses, and
camels, being given up to the Roman treasury. The
laws and institutions of the Palmyrenes shall be
respected.&#8221;</p>

<p>To this letter Zenobia returned the following
answer:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Zenobia, Queen of the East, to the Roman Emperor,
Aurelian.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Never was such an unreasonable demand proposed,
or such rigorous terms offered, by any but
yourself! Remember, Aurelian, that in war, whatever
is done should be done by valour. You imperiously
command me to surrender: but can you
forget, that Cleopatra chose rather to die with the
title of queen, than to live in any inferior dignity?
We expect succours from Persia; the Saracens are
arming in our cause; even the Syrian banditti have
already defeated your army. Judge what you are to
expect from the junction of these forces. You shall
be compelled to abate that pride with which, as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
you were absolute lord of the universe, you command
me to become your captive.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Aurelian read this letter, says Vopiscus, he
blushed; not so much with shame, as with indignation.</p>

<p>Her answer inflamed the emperor to the highest
pitch. He pressed the siege, therefore, with redoubled
vigour; and the city was reduced to such
extremities, that her council advised her to send for
succour to the Persians. Thus counselled, she determined
on going to the king of Persia in person. She
set out, therefore, on the fleetest of her dromedaries,
and had already reached the banks of the Euphrates
(about sixty miles from Palmyra), when she was
overtaken by Aurelian&#8217;s light horse, and brought
back, captive, to the feet of Aurelian. We are told,
that the sight of the queen gave the Roman emperor
infinite pleasure; but that his ambition suffered some
humiliation, when he considered that posterity would
always look upon this only as the conquest of a
woman<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a>. The city surrendered soon after, and was
treated with great lenity.</p>

<p>Aurelian now went to Emesa; on arriving at
which place, he questioned the queen as to her motives,
and the persons who had advised her to make
so obstinate a defence. He sternly asked her, how
she had presumed to rise in arms against the emperors
of Rome? &#8220;Because,&#8221; answered Zenobia, &#8220;I
disdained to consider as Roman emperors an Aureolus
or a Gallienus. You alone I acknowledge as my
conqueror and my sovereign; and this I do, because
you know how to conquer.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>
<p>When, however, the soldiers demanded her immediate
execution, her fortitude forsook her. She confessed
by whose counsel she had been guided. She
purchased a dishonourable life at the expense of
her friends. They were immediately led to execution;
herself was reserved to grace the conqueror&#8217;s
triumph.</p>

<p>Among those of her friends, whose names she had
betrayed, was the illustrious Longinus, author of
that noble Treatise on the Sublime, which is so well
known and appreciated by every scholar. He it was,
she confessed, who had drawn up the letter. &#8220;Her
councillors,&#8221; she said, &#8220;were to be blamed, and not
herself. What could a weak, short-sighted, woman
do? especially when beset by artful and ambitious
men, who made her subservient to all their schemes?
She never had aimed at empire, had they not placed
it before her eyes in all its allurements. The letter
which affronted Aurelian was not her own&mdash;Longinus
wrote it; the insolence was his.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Aurelian heard this, he directed all his fury
against the unfortunate Longinus. That illustrious
person was immediately led to execution. Far from
lamenting his fate, however, he condoled with his
friends, pitied Zenobia, and expressed his joy; looking
upon death as a blessing, since it would rescue
his body from slavery, and give his soul to that freedom
he the most desired. &#8220;This world,&#8221; said he,
with his expiring breath, &#8220;is nothing but a prison;
happy, therefore, is he who gets soonest out of it, and
gains his liberty.&#8221;</p>

<p>A modern poet has very finely alluded to this in
his poem on Palmyra.</p>

<span class="i0">But where the stirring crowd, the voice of strife,</span>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>Palmyra, having become subject to a foreign yoke,
bore the burthen with impatience. The inhabitants
cut off the Roman garrison. On which Aurelian
instantly returned, took the town, destroyed it, and
put to death most of its population, without distinction
of age or sex. The slaughter was so extensive,
that none were left to plough the adjacent lands.</p>

<p>Aurelian soon repented of his severity. He wrote
to Bassus:&mdash;&#8220;You must now sheathe the sword;
the Palmyrenes have been sufficiently slaughtered.
We have not spared women; we have slain children;
we have strangled old men; we have destroyed the
husbandmen. To whom, then, shall we leave the
land? To whom shall we leave the city? We
must spare those who remain; for we think, that the
few there are now existing, will take warning from
the punishment of the many who have been destroyed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The emperor then goes on to desire his lieutenant
to rebuild the Temple of the Sun as magnificently as
it had been in times past; to expend 300 pounds
weight of gold, which he had found in the coffers of
Zenobia, beside 1800 pounds weight of silver, which
was raised from the sale of the people&#8217;s goods;
together with the crown jewels, all which he ordered
to be sold, to make money to beautify the temple;
while he himself promises to write to the Senate, to
send a priest from Rome to dedicate it. But, in
the language of Gibbon, it is easier to destroy than
it is to restore.</p>

<p>Zenobia was now to be led to the conqueror&#8217;s
triumph. This triumph was celebrated with extraordinary
magnificence. It was opened by twenty
elephants, four royal tigers, and above two hundred
of the most curious animals from every climate of the
known world. Ambassadors from &AElig;thiopia, Arabia,
Persia, Bactriana, India, and China, attended the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
triumph; and a long train of captives,&mdash;Goths,
Vandals, Sarmatians, Alemanni, Franks, Gauls,
Syrians, and Egyptians. Amongst these, Zenobia.
She was confined in fetters of gold; a slave supported
the gold chain which encircled her neck, and she
almost fainted under the weight of her jewels. She
did not ride, but walk! preceded by the chariot in
which she had once indulged the vain hope of entering
Rome as empress<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a>.</p>

<p>The Palmyrenes<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a>, says Zosimus, had several
declarations from the gods, which portended the overthrow
of their empire; and, among others, having
consulted the temple of Apollo, at Seleucia in Cilicia,
to know if they should ever obtain the empire of the
East, they got the following unceremonious answer:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Avoid my temple, cursed, treacherous nation!</span>
<span class="i0">You even put the gods themselves in passion.</span>
</div></div>

<p>The religion of the Palmyrenes, it is evident, was
pagan; their government, for the most part, republican;
but their laws are entirely lost; nor can anything
be known in respect to their polity, but what
may be gathered from the inscriptions. Their chief
deity was the Sun.</p>

<p>In regard to their knowledge of art, they have
left the finest specimens in the ruins that now remain;
and, doubtless, Longinus&#8217; work on the Sublime
was written within its walls. &#8220;From these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>hints we may see,&#8221; says Mr. Wood, &#8220;that this
people copied after great models in their manners,
their vices, and their virtues. Their funeral
customs were from Egypt, their luxury was Persian,
and their letters and arts were from the Greeks.
Their situation in the midst of these three great
nations makes it reasonable to suppose, that they
adopted most of their customs and manners. But
to say more on that head from such scanty materials,
would be to indulge too much in mere conjecture,
which seems rather the privilege of the reader than
of the writer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some years after this, we find Diocletian erecting
several buildings here; but what they were is not
stated. Justinian, also, repaired Palmyra, which,
according to Procopius, had been almost entirely
deserted. These repairs, however, are supposed to have
reference rather to strength than to ornament; and
this is the last mention of Palmyra in Roman history.</p>

<p>The various fortunes of Palmyra, to and from
the time of Mahomet&#8217;s appearance, are scarcely
known, except that it was considered as a place of
great strength; and that in the twelfth century,
<span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 1171, there were, according to Benjamin of
Tudela, who visited the spot in that year, two thousand
Jews in it.</p>

<p>Palmyra, according to the Arabs, once occupied an
area nearly ten miles in circumference, and is supposed
to have been reduced to its present confined
and ruined state by the quantities of sand<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> driven on
it by whirlwinds.</p>

<p>The walls of the city were flanked by square towers.
They were three miles in circumference, and it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>imagined that they included the great temple. What
remains there are of the wall, do not look, according
to Mr. Wood, unlike the work of Justinian; and
may be part of the repairs mentioned by Procopius;
and the highest antiquity anything else can claim is
the time of the Mamelukes.</p>

<p>We shall now give place to accounts in respect to
the first impressions, made by these ruins on the
minds of different travellers.</p>

<p>Mr. Halifax says<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a>, &#8220;the city itself appears to have
been of a large extent by the space now taken up by
the ruins;&#8221; but that there are no footsteps of any walls
remaining, nor is it possible to judge of the ancient
figure of the place. The present inhabitants, as they are
poor, miserable, dirty people, so they have shut themselves
up, to the number of about thirty or forty families,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
in little huts made of dirt, within the walls
of a spacious court, which inclosed a most magnificent
heathen temple: thereinto also Mr. Halifax&#8217;s
party entered, the whole village being gathered
together at the door; whether to stand upon
their defence in case the strangers proved enemies
(for some of them had guns in their hands), or out
of mere curiosity to gaze, he knew not. However the
guide, who was an Arab whom Assyne their king
had sent to conduct them through the village, being
a man known among them, they had an easy admittance;
and, with a great many welcomes in their
language, were led to the sheik&#8217;s house, with whom
they took up their abode. &#8220;And to mention here
what the place at first view represented, certainly
the world itself could not afford the like mixture of
remains of greatest state and magnificence, together
with the extremity of poverty and wretchedness.&#8221;
The nearest parallel Mr. Halifax could think of, was
that of the temple of Baal, destroyed by Jehu, and
converted into a draught-house.</p>

<p>&#8220;We had scarce passed the sepulchres,&#8221; says Mr.
Wood, &#8220;when the hills opening discovered to us all
at once the greatest quantity of ruins we had ever seen,
all of white marble; and beyond them, towards the
Euphrates, a flat waste as far as the eye could reach,
without any object that showed either life or motion.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Mr. Wood&#8217;s party arrived, they were conducted
to one of the huts, of which there were about
thirty, in the court of the great temple. The inhabitants
of both sexes were well-shaped, and the
women, though very swarthy, had good features.
They were veiled; but did not so scrupulously conceal
their faces as the Eastern women generally do.
They paint the ends of their fingers red, their lips
blue, and their eyebrows and eyelashes black<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>
<p>They had large rings of gold or brass in their ears
and nostrils, and appeared to be healthy and robust.</p>

<p>The ruins were next visited by Mr. Bruce:&mdash;&#8220;When
we arrived at the top of the hill,&#8221; says he, &#8220;there
opened before us, the most astonishing, stupendous,
sight, that perhaps ever appeared to mortal sight.
The whole plain below, which was very extensive,
was covered so thick with magnificent ruins, as the
one seemed to touch the other, all of fine proportions,
all of agreeable forms, all composed of white stone,
which, at that distance, appeared like marble. At
the end of it stood the Palace of the Sun, a building
worthy so magnificent a scene.&#8221;</p>

<p>The effect on the imagination of Mr. Addison appears
to have been equally lively:&mdash;&#8220;At the end of
the sandy plain,&#8221; says he, &#8220;the eye rests upon the
lofty columns of the Temple of the Sun, encompassed
by a dark elevated mass of ruined buildings; and
beyond, all around, and right and left towards the
Euphrates, as far as the eye can reach, extends
the vast level naked flat of the great desert, over
which the eye runs in every direction, piercing the
boundless horizon, without discovering a human
being or a trace of man. Naked, solitary, unlimited
space extends around, where man never breathes
under the shade, or rests his limbs under the cover of
a dwelling. A deep blue tint spreads along its surface,
here and there shaded with a cast of brown; the
distant outline of the horizon is clear and sharply
defined; not an eminence rises to break the monotonous
flat, and along the edge extends a large
district covered with salt, distinguished from the rest
by its peculiar colour.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is something grand and awe-inspiring in its
boundless immensity. Like the first view of the ocean,
it inspires emotions, never before experienced, unearthly
in appearance, and out of character with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
general fair face of nature. The eye shrinks from contemplating
the empty, cheerless solitude, and we
turn away in quest of some object to remove the
scenes of utter loneliness, that its gloomy aspect is
calculated to inspire.&#8221;</p>

<p>From these pages we turn with satisfaction to
those of an American:&mdash;&#8220;I have stood before the
Parthenon, and have almost worshipped that divine
achievement of the immortal Phidias. I have been
at Milan, at Ephesus, at Alexandria, at Antioch;
but in none of these renowned cities I have beheld
any thing, that I can allow to approach in united
extent, grandeur, and most consummate beauty, this
almost more than work of man. On each side of
this, the central point, there rose upward slender
pyramids&mdash;pointed obelisks&mdash;domes of the most graceful
proportions, columns, arches, and lofty towers,
for number and for form, beyond my power to describe.
These buildings, as well as the walls of the
city, being all either of white marble, or of some
stone as white, and being everywhere in their whole
extent interspersed, as I have already said, with
multitudes of overshadowing palm trees, perfectly
filled and satisfied my sense of beauty, and made me
feel, for the moment, as if in such a scene I should
love to dwell, and there end my days.&#8221;</p>

<p>Burckhardt speaks thus of Palmyra and Balbec:&mdash;&#8220;Having
seen the ruins of Tadmor, a comparison
between these two renowned remains of antiquity
naturally offered itself to my mind. The temple
of the Sun at Tadmor, is upon a grander scale
than that of Balbec, but it is choked with Arab
houses, which admit only a view of the building in
detail. The architecture of Balbec is richer than
that of Tadmor.&#8221;</p>

<p>In respect to the ruins, we must content ourselves
with giving a very general account, as it would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
impossible to render a minute description intelligible
without the aid of plates.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> Our account will be a
compilation from those given by Mr. Halifax, Mr.
Wood, Mr. Bruce, Mr. Addison, and other writers,
who have been there.</p>

<p>The entire number of distinct buildings, which
may still be traced, are from forty to fifty. To the
northward of the valley of the tombs, on the highest
eminence in the immediate vicinity, towers the ruined
Turkish or Saracenic castle. It is seated on the
very summit of the mountain, and surrounded by a
deep ditch, cut out of the solid rock. It is said by
the Arabs to have been built by Man Ogle, a prince
of the Druses; its deserted chambers and passages
partake of the universal solitude and silence; there
is not a living thing about it; it seems to be deserted
even by the bats.</p>

<p>From this castle is seen an extensive view round
about: you see Tadmor under you, inclosed on three
sides with long ridges of mountains, which open
towards the east gradually, to the distance of about
an hour&#8217;s riding; but to the east stretches a vast plain
beyond the reach of the eye. In this plain you see
a large valley of salt, lying about an hour&#8217;s distance
from the city<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>It is imagined by the Persians that this castle, as
well as the edifices at Balbec, were built by genii,
for the purposes of hiding in their subterranean
caverns immense treasures, which still remain there<a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a>.
&#8220;All these things,&#8221; said one of the Arabs to Mr.
Wood, &#8220;were done by Solyman ebn Doud, (Solomon,
the son of David,) by the assistance of spirits.&#8221;</p>

<p>But of all the monuments of art and magnificence,
the most considerable is the Temple of the Sun.</p>

<p>This temple, says Bruce, is very much ruined; of its
peristyle there only remains<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> a few columns entire,
Corinthian, fluted and very elegant, though apparently
of slenderer proportions than ten diameters.
Their capitals are quite destroyed. The ornament of
the outer gate are, some of them, of great beauty, both
as to execution and design.</p>

<p>Within the court are the remains of two rows of
very noble marble pillars, thirty-seven feet high.
The temple was encompassed with another row of
pillars, fifty feet high; but the temple itself was only
thirty-three yards in length, and thirteen or fourteen
in breadth. This is now converted into a mosque,
and ornamented after the Turkish manner.</p>

<p>North of this place is an <span class="smcap">OBELISK</span>, consisting of
seven large stones, besides its capital, and the wreathed
work above it, about fifty feet high, and just above the
pedestal twelve in circumference. Upon this was
probably a statue, which the Turks have destroyed.</p>

<p>On the west side is a most magnificent arch, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>the remains of which are some vines and clusters of
grapes, carved in the boldest imitation of nature that
can be conceived.</p>

<p>Just over the door are discerned a pair of wings,
which extend its whole breadth; the body to which
they belong is totally destroyed, and it cannot now
certainly be known, whether it was that of an eagle
or of a cherub, several representations of both being
visible on other fragments of the building.</p>

<p>The north end of the building is adorned with a
curious fret-work and bas-relief; and in the middle
there is a dome or cupola, about ten feet in diameter,
which appears to have been either hewn out of the
rock, or moulded of some composition, which, by
time, is grown equally hard.</p>

<p>At about the distance of a mile from the <span class="smcap">OBELISK</span>
are two others, besides the fragment of a third; hence
it has been reasonably suggested, that they were
a continued row.</p>

<p>Every spot of ground intervening between the
walls and columns, is laid out in plantations of corn
and olives, inclosed by mud walls.</p>

<p>In the direction of the mountains lie fragments of
stone, here and there columns stand erect, and clumps
of broken pillars are met with at intervals. All this
space seems to have been covered with small temples
and ornamental buildings, approached by colonnades.</p>

<p>Next to the temple, the most remarkable structure
is the long portico, which commences about two
thousand two hundred feet to the north-west of the
temple, and extends for nearly four thousand feet
further in the same direction. &#8220;It is a remark
worthy the observation of historians,&#8221; says Volney,
&#8220;that the front of the portico has twelve pillars like
that at Balbec; but what artists will esteem still
more curious is that these two fronts resemble the
gallery of the house built by Perrault, long before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
existence of the drawing which made us acquainted
with them. The only difference is, that the columns
of the Louvre are double, whereas those of Palmyra
are detached.&#8221;</p>

<p>About one hundred paces from the middle obelisk,
straight forward, is a magnificent entry to a piazza,
which is forty feet broad and more than half a mile
in length, inclosed with two rows of marble pillars,
twenty-six feet high, and eight or nine feet in compass.
Of these there still remain one hundred and
twenty-nine; and, by a moderate computation,
there could not, originally, have been less than five
hundred and sixty. The upper end of the piazza
was shut in by a row of pillars, standing somewhat
closer than those on each side.</p>

<p>A little to the left are the ruins of a stately building,
which appears to have been a <i>banqueting-house</i>.
It is built of better marble, and is finished with
greater elegance, than the piazza. The pillars which
supported it were one entire stone, which is so strong
that one of them, which has fallen down, has received
no injury. It measures twenty-two feet in length,
and in compass eight feet nine inches.</p>

<p>In the west side of the piazza are several apertures
for gates, into the court of the palace. Each of these
is adorned with four porphyry pillars; not standing
in a line with those of the wall, but placed by
couples in the front of the gate facing the palace, on
each side. Two of these only remain, and but one
standing in its place. These are thirty feet long, and
nine in circumference.</p>

<p>&#8220;We sometimes find a palace,&#8221; says Volney, &#8220;of
which nothing remains but the courts and walls;
sometimes a temple, whose peristyle is half thrown
down; and now a portico, a gallery, or a triumphant
arch. Here stand groups of columns, whose symmetry
is destroyed by the fall of many of them;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
these we see ranged in rows of such length, that,
similar to rows of trees, they deceive the sight, and
assume the appearance of continued walls. On which
side soever we look, the earth is strewed with vast
stones, half buried, with broken entablatures, damaged
capitals, mutilated friezes, disfigured reliefs,
effaced sculptures, violated tombs, and altars defiled
with mud.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In their ruined courts,&#8221; says another traveller,
&#8220;and amid the crumbling walls of their cottages,
may be seen, here and there, portions of the ancient
pavement of the area; while all around the inclosure
extend groups of columns, with pedestals for statues,
and walls ornamented with handsome architectural
decorations, the ruins of the majestic portico and
double colonnade, which once inclosed the whole of
the vast area. Portions of a frieze, or the fragments
of a cornice, upon whose decoration was expended
the labour of years, are now used by the poor villagers
to bake their bread upon, or are hollowed out
as hand-mills, in which to grind their corn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Among the walls and rubbish are a vast number
of lizards and serpents; and that circumstance led to
the celebrated poetic picture painted by Darwin.</p>

</div></div>

<p>On the eastern side of the area of the Temple of the
Sun, there is a curious doorway of one solid block of
stone, which commands a fine view of the desert.
&#8220;As we looked out of this narrow gateway,&#8221; says
Mr. Addison, &#8220;we fancied, that Zenobia herself
might have often stood at the same spot, anxiously
surveying the operations of Aurelian and his blockading
army. From hence the eye wanders over the
level waste, across which the unfortunate queen fled
on her swift dromedary to the Euphrates; and here,
the morning after her departure, doubtless congregated
her anxious friends, to see if she was pursued
in her flight; and from hence she was probably first
descried, being brought back a captive and a prisoner
in the hands of the Roman horsemen.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the east side of the Piazza, stands a great number
of marble pillars: some perfect, but the greater
part mutilated. In one place eleven are ranged together
in a square; the space, which they inclose, is
paved with broad flat stones; but there are no remains
of a roof.</p>

<p>At a little distance are the remains of a small temple,
which is also without a roof; and the walls are
much defaced; but from the door is enjoyed the
magnificent coup-d&#8217;&#339;il of all the ruins, and of the
vast desert beyond. Before the entry, which looks
to the south, is a piazza, supported by six pillars,
two on each side of the door, and one at each end.
The pedestals of those in front have been filled with
inscriptions in the Greek and Palmyrene languages,
which are become totally illegible.</p>

<p>Among these ruins there are many <span class="smcap">Sepulchres</span>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
They are ranged on each side of a hollow way,
towards the north part of the city, and extend more
than a mile. They are all square towers, four or
five stories high. But though they are alike in form,
they differ greatly in magnificence. The outside
is of common stone; but the floors and partitions of
each story are marble. There is a walk across the
whole building, just in the middle; and the space on
each hand is subdivided into six partitions by thick
walls. The space between the partitions is wide
enough to receive the largest corpse; and in these
niches there are six or seven piled one upon another.</p>

<p>&#8220;As great a curiosity as any,&#8221; says Mr. Halifax,
&#8220;were these sepulchres, being square towers four or
five stories high, and standing on both sides of a hollow
way, towards the north part of the city. They
stretched out in length the space of a mile, and perhaps
formerly might extend a great way further. At our
first view of them, some thought them the steeples of
ruined churches, and were in hopes we should have
found some steps of churches here; others took them
to have been bastions, and part of the old fortifications,
though there is not so much as any foundation of a
wall to be seen. But when we came, a day or two
after, more curiously to inquire into them, we quickly
found their use. They were all of the same form,
but of different splendour and greatness, according to
the circumstances of their founders. The first we
viewed was entirely marble, but is now wholly in
ruins; and we found nothing but a heap of stones,
amongst which we found two statues; one of a man;
another of a woman, cut in sitting, or rather leaning,
posture, and the heads and part of the arms being
broken off; but their bodies remaining pretty entire;
so that we had the advantage of seeing their habits,
which appeared very noble; but more approaching
the European fashion, than what is now in use in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
East, which inclined me to think they might be
Roman. Upon broken pieces of stone, tumbled
here and there, we found some broken inscriptions,
but, not affording any perfect sense, they are not
worth the transcribing.&#8221;</p>

<p>These are the most interesting of all the ruins. As
you wind up a narrow valley between the mountain
range, you have them on your right and left, topping
the hills, or descending to the border of the valley:
some presenting heaps of rubbish, and some half fallen,
expose their shattered chambers, and one or two still
exist in almost an entire state of preservation. They
are seen from a great distance, and have a striking
effect in this desert solitude.</p>

<p>The ruins of Palmyra and Balbec are very different.
&#8220;No comparison can be instituted between
them,&#8221; says Mr. Addison. &#8220;The ruins of Balbec
consist merely of two magnificent temples, inclosed
in a sort of citadel; while here, over an immense area,
we wander through the ruins of long porticoes leading
up to ruined temples and unknown buildings. Now
we see a circular colonnade sweeping round with its
ruined gateway, at either end; now we come to the
prostrate walls, or ruined chambers of a temple or
palace; anon we explore the recesses of a bath, or the
ruins of an aqueduct; then we mount the solitary
staircase, and wander through the silent chambers of
the tombs, ornamented with busts, inscriptions, and
niches for the coffins, stored with mouldering bones;
and from the summits of funereal towers, five stories
in height, we look down upon this mysterious assemblage
of past magnificence; and beyond them, upon
the vast level surface of the desert, silent and solitary;
stretching away like the vast ocean, till it is lost in
the distance, far as the eye can reach. The dwelling
of man is not visible. The vastness and immensity of
space strikes us with awe, and the mouldering monuments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
of human pride, that extend around, teach us
a sad lesson of the instability of all human greatness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though antiquity has left nothing either in Greece
or Italy, in any way to be compared with the
magnificence of the ruins of Palmyra, Mr. Wood
observes, that there is a greater sameness in the
architecture of Palmyra than at Rome, Athens, and
other great cities, whose ruins evidently point out
different ages of decay. But, except four half-columns
in the Temple of the Sun, and two in one of the
mausoleums, the whole architecture is Corinthian,
richly ornamented with some very striking beauties
and some as visible faults.</p>

<p>Through the valley of the tombs may be traced
remnants of a ruined aqueduct, which formerly conducted
water to the town from, at present, an
unknown source; it consists of a vaulted passage
running underground, covered with a fine hard stucco.
In regard to the present supply, there are two rivers,
the waters of which, when judiciously distributed,
must have conduced greatly to the subsistence and
comfort of the ancient inhabitants; but these are
now allowed to lose themselves in the sand.</p>

<p>Mr. Wood says that all the inscriptions he saw
were in Greek or Palmyrene, except one, which was
in Latin. Many attempts have been made to explain
the Palmyrene inscriptions. They were generally
supposed to be Syriac. Gruter, having seen an
inscription at Rome, gave it as his opinion that the
characters were Arabic. Scaliger, speaking of the
same inscription, gave the subject up in despair.
Some have thought they were Greek, translated from
the Palmyrene. Upon this hint M. Barthelemy
examined the inscriptions copied into Mr. Wood&#8217;s
work, and came to the conclusion, that Syriac was
the living language of the inhabitants of Palmyra, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
the time those monuments were erected; and that the
greatest part, if not all the characters, are the same
as those made use of in writing Hebrew at this day,
although they have a different appearance.</p>

<p>We shall now give a few specimens:&mdash;&#8220;<i>This
splendid and durable monument, Jamblichus, the son
of Mocimus, the son of Acaleises, the son of Malichus,
erected for himself, his children, and his posterity, in
the month of April, year 314.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>There is another to the same purport, erected in
the same month, one hundred years after:&mdash;&#8220;<i>This
monument, Elab&aelig;lus Man&aelig;us Cocch&aelig;us Malachus,
the son of Waballathus, the son of Man&aelig;us, the son
of Elab&aelig;lus, built for himself and family in the month
of April, year 414.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Another inscription implies that &#8220;<i>Septimius Odenathus,
the most excellent senator, had erected this
monument for himself and his posterity, to preserve
their name for ever</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another contains an epitaph erected by Soræchus,
to his wife Martha, in the reign of Marcus Antoninus,
<span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 178.</p>

<p>A third is of the same nature; appropriated by
Malchus, to himself and his children, though built
by his ancestors.</p>

<p>Besides sepulchral monuments there are others,
erected by order of the senate and people of the commonwealth
of Tadmor, to the honour of those citizens
who had deserved well of the republic. Among these
is one in honour of Alilamenes; another in honour
of Julius Aurelius Zenobius; another in honour
of Jarisbolus; and others in honour of Septimius
Orodes. The last of these was a great benefactor to
the public and private institutions of Palmyra. He
had been an officer in his younger days, and had
greatly distinguished himself under his prince, Odenathus,
against the Parthians; during the year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
in which this monument was erected, he exercised
the office of symposiarch, in the festival dedicated to
their Patron God, Jupiter Belus. That in honour
of Alilamenes runs thus:&mdash;&#8220;The senate and the people
have placed this in honour of Alilamenes, the
son of Panas, the son of Mocimus, the son of &AElig;ranes,
devoted lovers of their country, and in every respect
deserving well of their country, and of the immortal
Gods, in the year 450, and the 30th day of the
month of April.&#8221;</p>

<p>There are, also, monuments erected by private
persons to the memory of their friends. The finest
of these contains the grateful remembrance which
the Palmyrene merchants, trading to Vologesias<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a>,
retained of the great services which Julius Zobeidas
did them in that expedition.</p>

<p>Another inscription commemorates the virtues of
a person named Malenthon, secretary to the republic
of Palmyra, when &#8220;the God Hadrian&#8221; arrived in
the city (<span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 122). He is remembered for having
contributed to the adornment of the temple of Belus,
and for having given a largess to the public baths, of
oil for the use, not only of the citizens, but of
strangers.</p>

<p>The monument erected to Jamblichus seems to
be the oldest, and the work of Domitian the latest;
taking in about three hundred years between them.
The other rich and extensive buildings were, Mr.
Wood supposes, erected <i>before</i> the <i>last</i> of these dates,
and probably <i>after</i> the <i>first</i>; perhaps about the time
<span class="smcap">Elabælus</span> built his monument.</p>

<p>It is rather remarkable, that there is no monument
in memory of, nor any inscription in honour of
Zenobia; for which Dr. Halley accounts on the
supposition, that the Romans were so much irritated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>and ashamed, that they destroyed and defaced everything
that might be erected in honour of her.</p>

<p>The decay of Palmyra has been accounted for from
its peculiar situation. A country without land, if
the expression may be allowed, could only exist by
commerce: their industry had no other channel to
operate in; and when loss of their liberty was followed
by that of trade, they were reduced to live
idly on as much of their capital as had been spared
by Aurelian. When that was spent, necessity
compelled them to desert the town.</p>

<p>Time has partially preserved the peristyles, the
intercolumniations, and entablatures; the elegance of
the designs of which equal throughout the richness
of the materials. These being, in many respects,
the greatest and most entire, is attributed to there
having been, for so long a time, few inhabitants to
deface them, to a dry climate, and their distance
from any city which might apply the materials to
other uses. These ruins present a sad contrast with
the hovels of the wild Arabs, now the only inhabitants
of a city which, in former times, emulated
Rome. &#8220;Of all the contrasts of past magnificence
with present meanness,&#8221; says Mr. Addison, &#8220;of the
wealth and genius of by-gone times with the poverty
and ignorance of the present day, no more striking
instance, perhaps, can be found than is presented in
the present poor Arab village of Tadmor. You there
see a few poverty-stricken inhabitants living in
square hovels of mud mixed with chopped straw,
roofed with earth, leaves, and dry sticks, congregated
round the magnificent Temple of the Sun of
yore; despoiled of its ornaments by one of the haughtiest
and most powerful of the Roman emperors,
who came with his victorious troops from the distant
provinces of Gaul and of Britain, to rend asunder
the dominion of which this spot, in the midst of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
desert solitudes, had rendered itself the head.&#8221; Mr.
Addison then goes on to state that the &#8220;<i>village
of Tadmor</i> consists, altogether, of about a dozen or
fifteen families, and there can be hardly more than
twenty able-bodied males in the whole place. This
little community possesses a few herds of goats and
dromedaries, which, together with the poultry, form
the chief wealth of the villagers. These poor people
are not, however, sufficiently advanced in the
desert to be without the reach of the Syrian government;
they all pay a capitation tax to Ibrahim
Pasha. The portion of cultivated land on this spot
is very small; there are merely a few scanty gardens,
which produce roots, vegetables, and a miserable
supply of corn. There are one or two palm-trees
along the banks of the stream, and a few shrubs of
the thorny acacia.&#8221;</p>

<p>These ruins were, some years ago, visited by a lady
who has made a great noise in Syria&mdash;Lady Hester
Stanhope. During her residence there she gave a kind
of fête to the Bedouins. &#8220;The great sheikh,&#8221; says Mr.
Carne, in his letters from the East, &#8220;and some of his
officers constantly reside at the ruins. Their habitations
are fixed near the great temple; they are all well-disposed
and civil in their manners, and their young
women are remarkable above all the other tribes for
their beauty. It was a lovely day, and the youth of
both sexes, dressed in their gayest habiliments, were
seated in rows on the fragments of the pillars, friezes,
and other ruins with which the ground was covered.
Her ladyship, in her Eastern dress, walked among
them, addressed them with the utmost affability, and
ordered a dollar to be given to each. As she stood
with all that Arab array amidst the columns of the
great Temple of the Sun, the sight was picturesque
and imposing, and the Bedouins hailed her with the
utmost enthusiasm &#8216;queen of Palmyra,&#8217; &#8216;queen of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
the desert;&#8217; and, in their enthusiasm, would have proceeded
to confer more decided marks of sovereignty;
but they were declined.&#8221;</p>

<p>This fête was afterwards described to Mr. Buckingham
by an Arab, who had been present, in the
following hyperbolical style:&mdash;&#8220;As soon as it was
known in the desert that the princess intended to
journey to Tadmor, all the tribes were in motion; war
was changed to universal peace, and every sheik, or
chief, was eager to have the honour of leading the
escort. Councils and assemblies were held at Horis
and at Hamak, at Sham, and at Thaleb, Damascus,
and Aleppo; messengers were sent in every direction,
and nothing was neglected that might serve to make
the way full of pleasure. When money was talked
of, every one rejected it with indignation, and exclaimed,
&#8216;Shall we not serve the princess for honour?&#8217;
Every thing being settled, the party set out,
preceded by horsemen in front, dromedaries of observation
on the right and the left, and camels laden
with provisions in the rear. As they passed along,
the parched sands of the desert became verdant
plains; the burning wells became crystal streams;
rich carpets of grass welcomed them at every place
where they stopped for repose, and the trees under
which they pitched their tents, expanded to twice their
size to cover them with shade. When they reached
the broken city (the ruins), the princess was taken
to the greatest of all the palaces (the Temple of the
Sun), and there gold and jewels were bound round
her temples, and all the people did homage to her as
a queen, by bowing their heads to the dust. On
that day Tadmor was richer than Damascus, and
more peopled than Constantinople; and if the princess
had only remained, it would soon have become the
greatest of all the cities of the earth: for men were
pouring into it from all quarters; horsemen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
chiefs, merchants and munugemein (astrologers and
learned men who consult the stars); the fame of her
beauty and benevolence having reached to Bagdad
and Isfahan, to Bokhara and Samarcand; the greatest
men of the East being desirous of beholding it for
themselves.&#8221; The Arab, who firmly believed all this,
narrated the return from Palmyra in the same
romantic strains; and ended by repeating his regret
at the misfortune of not having been one of the happy
multitude, assembled on that occasion; he having
been then on some business with another tribe to
the south of the Dead Sea<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a>.</p>

<p>Lady Hester is now dead. The following account
is taken from a paper published originally at Smyrna:
&#8220;We announced in our last number the death of Lady
Hester Stanhope. Our readers will no doubt be glad
to have a brief sketch of the principal circumstances of
that extraordinary woman&#8217;s life. It was at Djouni,
in Syria, that Lady Hester died, after a long illness,
at the age of sixty-four. That reader must be indifferent,
who reverts not with interest to his recollections
of a woman, who has expired on the borders of
the desert, amidst the Druses and Turkomans, over
whom that noble daughter of the Infidels once exercised
so strange and so marvellous a sway. The
destiny of Lady Stanhope presents one of those features
of which not another instance could, perhaps,
be found in the annals of the East. Only imagine
forty thousand Arabs suddenly assembled upon the
ruins of Palmyra, and these wandering, savage, and
indomitable tribes surrounding, in silent astonishment
and admiration, a foreign woman, and proclaiming
her Sovereign of the Desert and Queen of
Palmyra! Convey yourself in thought to the scene
of this incredible triumph, and you will then conceive
what woman that must have been, who imposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>silence on Mussulman fanaticism, and created for
herself, as it were, by magic, a sovereignty in the
domains of Mohammed. &#8216;Lady Hester Stanhope,&#8217;
says M. de Lamartine, in his admirable work,
&#8216;was a niece of Mr. Pitt. On the death of her uncle,
she left England, and visited various parts of Europe.
Young, handsome, and rich, she was everywhere
received with the attention and interest due to her
rank, fortune, mind, and beauty; but she constantly
refused to unite her fate to that of her worthiest
admirers; and, after spending some years in the
principal capitals of Europe, embarked with a numerous
suite for Constantinople. The real cause of this
expatriation has never been known. Some have
ascribed it to the death of a young English officer,
who was killed at that period in Spain, and whom
an eternal regret rendered for ever present in Lady
Hester&#8217;s heart: others have imputed her voluntary
banishment to a mere love of adventure in a young
person of an enterprising and courageous character.
However this might be, she departed, spent some
years at Constantinople, and then sailed for Syria in
an English vessel, which carried also the larger part
of her fortune, as well as jewellery, trinkets, and
presents of all sorts, of very considerable value.&#8217; The
vessel encountered a storm in the gulf of Macri, on
the road to Caramania; the ship was wrecked, Lady
Hester Stanhope&#8217;s property was all lost, and it was
as much as she could do to save her own life.
Nothing, however, could shake her resolution. She
returned to England, gathered the remainder of her
fortune, sailed again for Syria, and landed at Latakia,
the ancient Laodicea. She had at first thought of
fixing her abode at Broussa, at the foot of the Olympus;
but Broussa is a commercial city, situate on the
avenues to the Ottoman capital, and reckoning not
less than sixty thousand inhabitants; and Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Hester sought the independence and solitude of
the desert. She therefore selected the wilderness
of Mount Lebanon, whose extreme ramifications
lose themselves in the sands. Ruined Palmyra&mdash;Zenobia&#8217;s
ancient capital&mdash;suited her fancy. The
noble exile took up her residence at Djouni, prepared
for every vicissitude. &#8216;Europe,&#8217; said she, &#8216;is a monotonous
residence; its nations are unworthy of freedom,
and endless revolution are their only prospects.&#8217;
She applied herself to the study of the Arabic language,
and strove to obtain a thorough acquaintance
with the character and manners of the Syrian people.
One day, dressed in the costume of the Osmanlis, she
set out for Jerusalem, Damascus, Aleppo, and the
desert; she advanced amidst a caravan loaded with
wealth, tents, and presents for the Scheiks, and was
soon surrounded by all the tribes, who knelt to her,
and submitted to her supremacy. It was not solely
by her magnificence, that Lady Hester had excited
the admiration of the Arabs: her courage had been
proved on more than one occasion; and she had
always faced peril with a boldness and energy which
the tribes well remembered. Lady Hester Stanhope
knew also how to flatter the Mahomedan prejudices.
She held no intercourse with Christians and Jews;
she spent whole days in the grotto of a santon, who
explained the Koran to her; and never appeared in
public without that mien of majestic and grave inspiration,
which was always unto oriental nations the
characteristic of prophets. With her, however, this
conduct was not so much the result of design, as of
a decided proneness to every species of excitement
and originality. Lady Hester Stanhope&#8217;s first abode
was but a monastery. It was soon transformed into
an oriental palace, with pavilions, orange-gardens and
myrtles, over which spread the foliage of the cedar,
such as it grows in the mountains of Lebanon. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
traveller, to whom Lady Hester opened this sanctuary,
would behold her clad in oriental garments. Her
head was covered with a turban made of red and
white cashmere. She wore a long tunic, with open
loose sleeves; large Turkish trousers, the folds of
which hung over yellow morocco boots, embroidered
with silk. Her shoulders were covered with a sort
of burnous, and a yataghan hung to her waist. Lady
Hester Stanhope had a serious and imposing countenance;
her noble and mild features had a majestic
expression, which her high stature and the dignity of
her movements enhanced. The day came when all
this <i>préstige</i>, so expensively kept up, suddenly vanished.
Lady Hester&#8217;s fortune rapidly declined; her
income yearly decreased; in short, the substantial
resources, which had, at one time, sustained the
magic of her extraordinary domination, were daily
forsaking her. The Queen of Palmyra then fell back
into the rank of mere mortals, and she who had signed
absolute firmans, enabling the traveller to visit in
security the regions of Palmyra&mdash;she, whose authority
the Sublime Porte had tacitly acknowledged&mdash;soon
saw her people disown her omnipotency. She was
left the title of queen, but it was but an empty name,
a mere recollection; and again the monastery&#8217;s silence
ruled over the solitude of Djouni. A queen, stripped
of her glory of a day, Lady Hester Stanhope has expired,
the sport of fate, at the moment the East is
convulsed. She has expired in obscurity and loneliness,
without even mingling her name with the great
events of which it is now the theatre.&#8221;</p>

<p>All this, if no exaggeration had been employed,
might have served to the excitation of a smile: but the
matter did not rest there. Lady Hester, or the Princess,
as she was styled, having given to the Sheik an
absurd paper of authority, no one is permitted to visit
Palmyra without paying a thousand piastres! &#8220;The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
consequence of which is,&#8221; says Mr. Carne, &#8220;several
travellers have left Syria without seeing the finest
ruins in the world<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a>.&#8221;</p>

<h2>NO. XI.&#8212;PATR&AElig;.</h2>

<p>&#8220;Night overtook us,&#8221; says Mr. Williams, &#8220;before
we reached Patras, anciently called Patræ. But such
a night! the moon was in full splendour; and while we
travelled among the mysterious scenes, we were often
tempted to pause and ask what could be those shadowy
towers, that were perpetually arresting our attention?
Nothing could be more pleasing or more romantic, than
the winding of our cavalry among the projecting rocks
and dismal hollows, when first a gleam of light prevailed,
and then a solemn darkness veiled and softened
all in sweet composure. The glow-worms, peeping
from the bushes, seemed like fairies&#8217; eyes; fireflies
glanced in thousands, like the sun&#8217;s bright rays
stealing on rippling waters in ebon shade; and how
divine the evening star appeared, tipping the dark
chain of Mount Olonos! The blackbird, too, with
its train of dear associations, awakened our peculiar
interest. All seemed, by their look of delight to say,
&#8216;Sing on, sweet bird! and tell us of our absent
friends and beloved country!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Patræ was a town of Peloponnesus, anciently
called <span class="smcap">Aroe</span>.</p>

<p>Diana had a temple there, and a statue formed of
ivory and gold, which was considered a masterpiece.
Apollo also had a temple, in which was a statue of
the god, raised by Icadius.</p>

<p>In the time of Pausanias, Patræ was also adorned
with porticoes, a theatre, and an odéum; the last of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>which was superior to any in Greece, with one
exception, viz. that of Herodes Atticus at Athens.
In the lower part of the city was a temple of Bacchus,
in which was an image preserved in a chest.
There was also one of Ceres, with a pleasant grove
and a prophetic fountain, which determined the events
of illness. After supplicating the goddess with
incense, the sick person is said to have appeared,
living or dead, in a mirror suspended so as to touch
the surface of the water<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a>.</p>

<p>Patræ was selected by Augustus as a place in
which to settle some of those, who had fought with
him at Actium. Some of the cities of Achaia were
made tributary to the Patrenses, and they continued
long to flourish after the decay of the neighbouring
states.</p>

<p>They were rich in the monuments of art. Pausanias
enumerates nineteen or twenty temples,
besides statues, altars, and marble sepulchres, existing
in his time in the city, the port, and the sacred
groves.</p>

<p>Patras, though it has now recovered the destruction,
was wholly destroyed by the Turks in 1770.
We must, however, first state, that in 1447 it made
the best defence against the Turks of any place in
the Peloponnesus. In 1532 it was taken and ransacked
by Doria. But of all its distresses the last
was the most terrible; this was in 1770. It had
lately been freed by the temporary success of Greek
insurgents from the yoke of the Turks; but the
appearance of the Athenians, who rushed through
the passes of the isthmus to the assistance of the
Mahometans, soon decided the fate of the place.
An army of ten thousand, both horse and foot,
entered the town through every avenue. It was not
a contest, but a carnage: not a Greek capable of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>bearing arms was spared, and the houses were all
burned to the ground<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a>.</p>

<p>In forty years, Patras recovered this calamity,
and is now said to be a flourishing place; but Mr.
Dodwell describes it as being composed, like all other
Turkish cities, of dirty and narrow streets; with
houses built of earth, baked in the sun; with eaves
overhanging the streets.</p>

<p>The few remains, which are in Patras, are of
Roman construction; and those neither grand, interesting,
nor well preserved. In the castle, however,
there are said to be several beautiful forms of
female statues: and here we have to state an instance
of barbarism, strikingly illustrative of the character
of the more ignorant portion of the Turks. Some
marble columns and mutilated statues having been
found, a few years ago, in the garden of a Turk, he
immediately broke them to pieces!</p>

<p>There are several large fissures in the walls of the
castle, occasioned by an earthquake, about forty
years ago; in which forty persons were killed in the
town, and thirteen crushed by the falling of one of
the turrets.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing can be,&#8221; says Mr. Hobhouse, &#8220;more
pleasant than the immediate vicinity of this town;
which is one blooming garden of orange and lemon
plantations, of olive groves, and currant grounds.
The temple and the statues, the theatre, the columns
and the marble porch, have disappeared: but the
valleys and the mountains, and some, not frequent,
fragments, of more value than all the costly monuments
of barbaric labour,&mdash;these still remain, and
remind the traveller, that he treads the ground
once trod by the heroes and sages of antiquity.
To traverse the native country of those, whose
deeds and whose wisdom have been proposed to all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>the polished nations of every succeeding age, as the
models which they should endeavour to imitate, but
must never hope to equal, with no other emotions
than would arise in passing through regions never
civilised, is unnatural; is impossible! No one would
roam with the same indifference through the sad
solitudes of Greece, and the savage wilds of America;
nor is the expression of feelings, which it is
the object and end of all liberal education to instil
and encourage, to be derided as the unprofitable
effusion of folly and affectation.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></p>

<h2>NO. XII.&mdash;PELLA.</h2>

<p>It was a long time before the Greeks had any
regard to Macedonia. The kings, living retired in
woods and mountains, it seemed not to be considered
as a part of Greece.</p>

<p>Pella was the capital of the kings of Macedon.
There Philip lived and reigned, and here Alexander
was born. After his death the kingdom of Macedon
frequently changed masters. Philip Aridæus was
succeeded by Cassander, who left three sons. Philip,
the eldest, died presently after his father. The
other two contended for the crown, without enjoying
it; both dying soon after without issue.</p>

<p>Demetrius Poliorcetes, Pyrrhus, and Lysimachus,
made themselves masters of all, or the greatest part
of Macedonia, sometimes in conjunction, and at other
times separately.</p>

<p>After the death of Lysimachus, Seleucus possessed
himself of Macedonia, but did not long enjoy it.</p>

<p>Ptolemy Ceraunus having slain the preceding
prince, seized the kingdom, and possessed it alone
but a very short time; having lost his life in a battle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
with the Gauls, who had made an irruption into
that country.</p>

<p>Sosthenes, who defeated the Gauls, reigned also
but a short time.</p>

<p>Antigonus Gonatus, the son of Demetrius Poliorcetes,
obtained peaceable possession of the kingdom
of Macedonia, and transmitted these dominions to
his descendants, after he had reigned thirty-four
years.</p>

<p>He was succeeded by his son, Demetrius, who
reigned ten years, and then died; leaving a son, named
Philip, who was but two years old.</p>

<p>Antigonus Doson, reigned twelve years, in the
quality of guardian to the young prince.</p>

<p>Philip, after the death of Antigonus, ascended
the throne, at the age of fourteen years. After
him, Perseus; who was defeated and taken prisoner
by Paulus &AElig;milius; and Macedonia, in consequence
of that victory, was added to the provinces of the
Roman empire, <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span> 160.</p>

<p>For this success Paulus &AElig;milius was honoured with
a triumph; and as a description of that ceremony will
serve to diversify our pages in a very agreeable
manner, we adopt the account afforded us by Plutarch.
&#8220;The people erected scaffolds in the Forum and
Circus, and all other parts of the city where they
could best behold the pomp. The spectators were
clad in white garments; all the temples were open
and full of garlands and perfumes; the ways cleared
and cleansed by a great many officers and tipstaffs,
that drove away such as thronged the passage, or
straggled up and down. This triumph lasted three
days. On the first, which was scarce long enough
for the sight, were to be seen the statues, pictures,
and images, of an extraordinary bigness, which were
taken from the enemy, drawn upon seven hundred
and fifty chariots. On the second, was carried, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
great many wains, the fairest and the richest armour
of the Macedonians, both of brass and steel, all
newly furbished and glittering; which, although
piled up with the greatest art and order, yet seemed
to be tumbled on heaps carelessly and by chance;
helmets were thrown on shields, coats of mail upon
greaves, Cretan targets, and Thracian bucklers and
quivers of arrows lay huddled among the horses&#8217;
bits; and through these appeared the points of
naked swords, intermixed with long spears. All
these arms were tied together in a way, that they
knocked against one another as they were drawn
along, and made a harsh and terrible noise; so that
the very spoils of the conquered could not be beheld
without dread. After these waggons loaden with
armour, there followed three thousand men, who
carried the silver that was coined, in seven hundred
and fifty vessels, each of which weighed three
talents, and was carried by four men. Others brought
silver bowls, and goblets, and cups, all disposed in
such order as to make the best show, and all valuable,
as well for their bigness, as the thickness of
their engraved work. On the third day, early in
the morning, first came the trumpeters, who did not
sound as they were wont in a procession or solemn
entry; but such a charge as the Romans use when
they encourage their soldiers to fight. Next followed
young men, girt about with girdles curiously wrought,
which led to the sacrifice of hundred and twenty
stalled oxen, with their horns gilded, and their heads
adorned with ribands and garlands; and with these
were boys that carried platters of silver and gold.
After this was brought the gold coin, which was divided
into vessels that weighed three talents, like to
those that contained the silver; they were in number
fourscore wanting three. These were followed by
those that brought the consecrated bowl, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
&AElig;milius caused to be made, that weighed ten
talents, and was all beset with precious stones. Then
were exposed to view the cups of Antigonus and
Seleucus, and such as were made after the fashion
invented by Thericles, and all the gold plate that was
used at Perseus&#8217;s table. Next to these came Perseus&#8217;s
chariot, in which his armour was placed, and
on that his diadem. And after a little intermission,
the king&#8217;s children were led captives, and with them
a train of nurses, masters, and governors, who all
wept, and stretched forth their hands to the spectators,
and taught the little infants to beg and entreat
their compassion. There were two sons and a
daughter, who, by reason of their tender age, were
altogether insensible of the greatness of their misery;
which insensibility of their condition rendered it
much more deplorable; insomuch, that Perseus himself
was scarce regarded as he went along, whilst
pity had fixed the eyes of the Romans upon the
infants, and many of them could not forbear tears;
all beheld the sight with a mixture of sorrow and
joy, until the children were past. After his children
and their attendants, came Perseus himself, clad
all in black, and wearing slippers, after the fashion
of his country. He looked like one altogether
astonished and deprived of reason, through the greatness
of his misfortunes. Next followed a great company
of his friends and familiars, whose countenances
were disfigured with grief, and who testified to all
that beheld them by their tears, and their continual
looking upon Perseus, that it was his hard fortune
they so much lamented, that they were regardless of
their own. After these were carried four hundred
crowns all made of gold, and sent from the cities by
their respective ambassadors to &AElig;milius, as a reward
due to his valour. Then he himself came seated on
a chariot magnificently adorned (a man worthy to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
beheld, even without these ensigns of power): he
was clad in a garment of purple interwoven with
gold, and held out a laurel branch in his right hand.
All the army, in like manner, with boughs of laurel
in their hands, and divided into bands and companies,
followed the chariot of their commander; some singing
odes (according to the usual custom) mingled
with raillery; others, songs of triumph, and the
praises of &AElig;milius&#8217;s deeds, who was admired and
accounted happy by all men; yet unenvied by every
one that was good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The ancient capital of the kings of Macedon,&#8221; says
Monsieur de Pouqueville, &#8220;does not announce itself in
its desolation to the eye of the stranger, as at Athens
and Corinth, by the display of the remains of its
ancient splendour. Its vestiges are found on an eminence
sloping to the south-west, and surrounded by
marshes. In vain, however, does the traveller look for
the walls of the city, for the citadel, for the dykes constructed
to defend from inundation the temples, buildings,
and the monuments of its grandeur. The barbarians
from the North, the Romans, and the succession
of ages, have destroyed even the ruins. The once
powerful city of Pella is now sunk down into fragments
of tombs, masses of brick and tile, and about
threescore huts, inhabited by Bulgarians, with a
tower garrisoned by about a dozen Albanians. Such
are the present edifices, population, and military
establishment of Pella, once the powerful capital of
Alexander and Perseus! A low Mahommedan now
commands, whip in hand, in the city where Alexander
first saw the light; and the paternal seat of that
monarch, whose dominions extended from the Adriatic
to the Indus, was, some years ago, the property
of Achmet, son of Ismael, Bey of Serres<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a>.&#8221;</p>

<h2>NO. XIII.&mdash;PERGAMUS.</h2>

<p>This was a city of Great Mysia, in Asia Minor,
the capital of the kingdom of Pergamus, which was
founded by a eunuch, named Philatera, who had
been a servant to Docima, a commander of the troops
of Antigonus.</p>

<p>Pergamus was assaulted by Philip, king of Macedon,
in his war against Attalus the First, who had taken
part with the Romans. All his efforts, however,
being unavailing, he turned his rage and fury against
the gods; and, not satisfied with burning their
temples, he demolished statues, broke to pieces their
altars, and even pulled up the stones from their
foundations, that not the least footsteps of them might
remain.</p>

<p>At the death of Attalus, his son Eumenes the
Second succeeded; and it was during his reign and
under his inspiration,&mdash;if such an expression may be
allowed&mdash;that the celebrated library was collected<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a>,
which makes such a figure in literary history.</p>

<p>The kingdom ceased to exist at the death of
Attalus the Third; since that prince left it to the
Roman people.</p>

<p>As this event was very important to the city as
well as kingdom of Pergamus, we may, with propriety,
enter a little into the character of the prince,
who made so extraordinary a bequeathment. Historians
relate, that he was scarcely on the throne
before he stained it with the blood of his nearest
relatives. He caused almost all those, who had served
his father and his uncle with extreme fidelity, to have
their throats cut; under pretence that some of them
had killed his mother, who died of a disease in a very
advanced age, and others his wife, who died of an
incurable distemper. He caused the destruction also
of wives, children, and whole families. Having committed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
all these enormities, he appeared no more in
the city, and ate no longer in public. He put on
old clothes, let his beard grow, and did every thing
which persons, accused of capital crimes, used to do
in those days; as if he intended thereby to acknowledge
the extent of his own atrocity. From hence
he proceeded to other species of folly and iniquity.
He renounced the cares of state, and retired into his
garden, and applied to digging the ground himself,
and sowing all sorts of poisonous as well as wholesome
herbs; then poisoning the good with the juice of the
bad, he sent them in that manner as presents to his
friends. At length he took it into his head to practise
the trade of a brass-founder; and formed the
model of a monument of brass to be erected to his
mother. As he was casting the metal for this purpose,
one hot summer&#8217;s day, he was seized with a
fever, which in a few days carried him off. The
principal clause in his will was expressed in these
terms:&mdash;&#8220;Let the people of Rome inherit all my
fortunes.&#8221; This will having been carried to Rome,
the city and kingdom of Pergamus, as we have
already stated, passed into a Roman province.</p>

<p>Pergamus gave birth to Apollodorus, the preceptor
of Augustus; and Galen, next to Hippocrates the
greatest physician that ever adorned the annals of
medical science. It is also remarkable for having been
alluded to by Tiberius, in one of his hypocritical
speeches to the Roman senate, as reported in Tacitus.
&#8220;I know very well,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that many men will
condemn me for suffering Asia to build me a temple,
as Spain at present would do: but I will give you a
reason for what I have done, and declare my resolution
for the future. The divine Augustus, whose
actions and words are so many inviolable laws to me,
having consented that the people of <i>Pergamus</i> should
dedicate a temple to him and the city of Rome, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
thought I might follow so great an example; so much
the rather, since the honour, intended me, was joined
with the veneration paid to the senate. But as on
the one hand it might have been too great a piece of
severity to have denied it for once; so on the other,
doubtless, it would be too great a vanity and folly,
to suffer one&#8217;s self to be adored as a God, through all
the provinces of the empire. Besides, it cannot but
be a great diminution to the glory of Augustus, to
communicate it indifferently to all the world. For
my own part, I am mortal, and subject to human infirmities;
I am contented with being a prince here,
without being raised to the throne of a God. I protest
to you, I desire this testimony may be given of
me to posterity. It will be glory enough for me to
be thought worthy of my ancestors; a vigilant prince,
one who is insensible of fear, when the commonwealth
is in danger. These are the temples and
monuments which I desire to erect in your breasts:
for works of marble and brass, raised to the glory of
princes, are contemned by posterity as so many naked
sepulchres, when their memory is condemned. I
entreat heaven to give me a serenity of mind, and a
spirit to discern and judge uprightly of the laws of
God and man; and after my decease, I confide, my
fellow-citizens and allies will preserve my memory
with their blessings and praises.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Turner found several ancient inscriptions at
Pergamus. He ascended the ancient Acropolis,
which is built on a mount of about two hundred feet
height, overhanging the town: on the top are extensive
remains of the walls both of the Roman and
Venetian city. Part of the walls are built with large
fluted columns, laid length-ways. Among the Roman
ruins are several immense arched caves under ground,
about sixty feet deep. At the top of the hill lay a
large Corinthian capital, and half way down the hill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
a small marble column, on which is a Greek inscription,
now illegible.</p>

<p>In a valley west of the Acropolis are considerable
remains of a large Roman amphitheatre; near which
is a gate with part of a wall. The arch of the gate
is curiously inclined, being unequal; the only instance
of such an irregularity Mr. Turner ever saw in an
ancient building. There are also ruins of several
Roman baths; in one of which was found a vase,
which has excited a great deal of admiration. Mr.
Turner thus describes it:&mdash;&#8220;It is of fine marble, and
in good preservation, being only a little broken round
the rim. The shape of it is a flattened globe; on the
outside round the circumference of the centre are
fifteen equestrian figures in high-relief; nine of these
have their heads much broken, nine have their arms
extended; the horses are all at full speed, and a race is
probably the subject represented, as none of the
figures bear arms. Five of the figures are clinging to
their horses, and one appears to be falling. Nothing,&#8221;
continues Mr. Turner, &#8220;can exceed the spirit of the
execution; the very horses seem to breathe; above
and below the figures a band, on which is engraved
the pattern of a laurel leaf, surrounds the vase: a
very correct engraving of which is given in the work
of Choiseul-Gouffier. There are said to have been
seven of these vases at Pergamus; six of which were
taken to Constantinople.&#8221;</p>

<p>There are also in the neighbourhood of Bergamo,
the present ruins of this city, six tumuli; three large
and three small<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a>.</p>

<p>This city is supposed to have been founded by
the famous Jemsheed, from whom it is to this day
called Tuklit-e-Jemsheed;&mdash;the throne of Jemsheed;
a prince, to whom Persian authors attribute the
invention of many useful arts<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a>; and to whom they
refer the first great reform in the manners and usages
of their countrymen. He, also, introduced the solar
year; and ordered the first day of it, when the sun
entered Aries, to be celebrated as a festival<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a>.</p>

<p>An old Persian author has left the following description
of Persepolis:&mdash;&#8220;Jemsheed built a fortified palace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>at the foot of a hill, which bounds the fine plain of
Murdasht to the north-west. The platform, on
which it was built, has three faces to the plain, and
one to the mountain. It is formed of hard, black
granite. The elevation from the plain is ninety
feet; and every stone, used in this building, is from
nine to twelve feet long, and broad in proportion.
There are two great flights of stairs to this palace, so
easy of ascent, that a man can ride up on horseback;
and on the platform a palace has been erected, part
of which still remains in its original state, and part
is in ruins. The palace of Jemsheed is that, now
called the Chesel-Setoon, or Forty Pillars. Each
pillar is formed of a carved stone, is sixty feet high,
and is ornamented in a manner so delicate, that it
would seem to rival upon hard granite the sculpture
of a carving upon the softest wood. There is no
granite like that, of which these pillars are made, to
be now found in Persia: and it is unknown from
whence it is brought. Some most beautiful and
extraordinary figures ornament this palace; and all
the pillars, which once supported the roof (for that
has fallen) are composed of three pieces of stone,
joined in so exquisite a manner, as to make the beholder
believe, that the whole shaft is one piece.
There are several figures of Jemsheed in the sculpture;
in one he has an urn in his hand, in which he
burns benjamin, while he stands adoring the sun; in
another, he is represented as seizing the mane of a
lion with one hand, while he stabs him with another.&#8221;</p>

<p>The remains of this city stands in one of the finest
plains of Persia; being eighteen or nineteen leagues
in length, and in some places two, in some four, and
in others six leagues in breadth. It is watered by
the great river Araxes, and by a multitude of rivers
beside. Within the compass of this plain there are
between one thousand and one thousand five hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
villages, without reckoning those in the mountains,
all adorned with pleasant gardens, and planted with
trees. The entrance of this plain, on the west side,
has received as much grandeur from nature, as the
city it covered could do from industry or art.</p>

<p>Some authors say, that to attempt any guess of
the period when the city first rose from the plain,
would be useless, and that the only means, now remaining,
of forming any satisfactory conjectures, in
regard to its origin, can only reach to the probable
era of the different remaining ruins. When in Persia,
however, Mr. Francklin met with a short account
of the building this palace, in MS., being part of a
work, called Rouzut al Sefa, or the Garden of Purity;
of which he gives this as a translation:&mdash;&#8220;It is
related by historians, that King Jemsheed removed
the seat of government, which was formerly in the
province of Sejestaun, to Fars; and that in the
neighbourhood of Shirauz, having taken in a spot of
ground, of twelve furlongs in length (forty-eight
English miles), he there erected such a palace, that
in the seven kingdoms of the world there was nothing
that could equal it. The remains of that palace, and
many of the pillars of it, are visible to this day; and
he caused the palace to be called Chehul Minar, or
Forty Pillars. Moreover, when the sun, quitting the
sign Pisces in the heavens, had entered Aries, Jemsheed,
having assembled all the princes, nobles, and
great men of his empire, at the foot of his imperial
throne, did on that day institute a grand and solemn
festival; and this day was henceforth called Noo Roze,
or first day of the new year (when the foundation
of Persepolis was laid), at which period he
commanded, from all parts of the empire, the attendance
of the peasants, husbandmen, soldiers, and
others, in order to prosecute the design; requesting
that all, with joyful hearts and willing hands, should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
lend their assistance in completing the work. This
numerous assembly obeyed the command of their
monarch, and the building was finished with all signs
of mirth and festivity.&#8221;</p>

<p>To this account the Persians add, that Queen
Homaie, who flourished about eight hundred years
after Jemsheed, added a thousand columns.</p>

<p>Diodorus gives some account of the workmen, that
were employed in building this palace. &#8220;Cambyses,
the son of Cyrus,&#8221; says he, &#8220;conquered Egypt in the
third year of the seventy-third olympiad, when he pillaged
the country and burnt the temples, the treasures
of which the Persians carried off into Asia; and they,
also, led away with them the workmen and architects
of Egypt, whom they caused to build the famous palace
of Persepolis, and of several other cities.&#8221; This account
appears the more probable, since, as M. le Comte de
Caylus is justly of opinion, they cannot be attributed
to the Persians before Cyrus; since Herodotus
describes the Persians of that age as a people of great
simplicity; having neither temples nor altars, but
worshipping Jupiter on the summits of mountains.
The account, here given, is sufficient to account for the
Egyptian appearance of Persepolis. There are appearances
of five different buildings united in one;
and each, apparently, of a different age, after the
manner of the Egyptians.</p>

<p>Though there are doubts as to the origin of Persepolis,
there are none as to the circumstance of its
being destroyed by Alexander.</p>

<p>As the conqueror drew near the city<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a>, he perceived
a large body of men, who presented a most
lamentable picture. These were about four thousand
Greeks, greatly advanced in years, who, having been
taken prisoners of war, had suffered all the torments
which Persian tyranny could invent. The hands of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>some had been cut off, the feet of others; and others
again had lost their noses and ears; after which,
having impressed by fire barbarous characters on their
faces, the Persians had the inhumanity to keep them
as so many laughing-stocks, with which they sported
perpetually. They appeared like so many shadows
rather than men. Alexander could not refrain from
tears at this sight; and as they unanimously besought
him to commiserate their condition, he bade them,
with the utmost tenderness, not to despond, and
assured them that they should again see their country.
This, however, the Greeks did not desire; being
unwilling to be seen by their former companions in
the dreadful state in which they were. They prayed
the king, therefore, to let them remain where they
were, but to relieve their awful condition.  This
Alexander did; but he was so enraged at what he
had seen, that he set the city on fire soon after.
The other account is, that the conqueror called his
generals together, and represented to them that no
city in the world had been more fatal to the Greeks
than Persepolis, the ancient residence of the Persian
monarchs, and capital of their empire. For that it
was from thence all those mighty armies poured,
which had overflowed Greece; and whence Darius,
and afterwards Xerxes, had carried the fire-brand of
the most accursed war which had laid waste the best
part of Europe; and therefore it was incumbent on
them to revenge the manes of their ancestors.</p>

<p>Animated by this, the soldiers force their way into
the city, put all the men to the sword, and rifle and
carry away every man&#8217;s goods and estate; amongst
which was abundance of rich and costly furniture
and ornaments of all sorts. There were hurried away,
here and there, vast quantities of silver, and no less
of gold, great numbers of rich garments, some of
purple, and others embroidered with gold; all of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
which, says Diodorus, became a plentiful prey to the
ravenous soldiers. For though every place was
full of rich spoil, yet the covetousness of the Macedonians
was insatiable. They were even so eager in
plundering, that they fought one another with drawn
swords; and many, who were conceived to have got
a larger share than the rest, were killed in the quarrel.
Some things, which were of extraordinary value, they
divided with their swords, and each took a share.
Others, in a rage, cut off the hands of such as laid
hold of a thing that was in dispute. They first
ravished the women as they were in their jewels and
rich attire, and then sold them for slaves. The
riches are said to have amounted to no less than
eighteen millions sterling!</p>

<p>Such is the account left us by Diodorus. He then
goes on to describe the destruction of the temple or
palace, burned down by Alexander. &#8220;Alexander,&#8221; says
he, &#8220;made a great feast for the entertainment of his
friends in commemoration of his victory, and offered
magnificent sacrifices to the gods. At this feast
were entertained women, who prostituted their bodies
for hire; when the cups went so high to drunkenness
and debauchery, that many were drunk and
mad. Among the rest there was a courtesan,
named Thais, an Athenian, then mistress to Ptolemy,
afterwards king of Egypt, who said in a gay tone
of voice, &#8216;That it would be a matter of inexpressible
joy to her, were she permitted, masked
as she then was, and in order to end the festival
nobly, to burn the magnificent palace of Xerxes,
who had burned Athens; and so set it on fire with
her own hand, in order that it might be said in
all parts of the world, that the women, who had followed
Alexander in his expedition to Asia, had taken
much better revenge on the Persians, for the many
calamities they had brought upon the Grecians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
than all the generals who had fought for them both
by sea and land.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;This spreading abroad, and coming to the ears of
the young men, presently one cries out, &#8216;Come on;
bring firebrands!&#8217; and so incites the rest to fire the
citadel, to revenge that impiety the Persians had
committed in destroying the temples of the Grecians.
At this, others with joy set up a shout; but said that
so brave an exploit belonged only to Alexander himself
to perform. The king, stirred up at these words,
embraced the proposition; upon which, as many as
were present left their cups and leaped upon the
table, and said that they would now celebrate a
victorious festival to Bacchus. Thereupon, multitudes
of firebrands were presently got together;
and all the women that played on musical instruments,
which were at the feast, were called for;
and then the king, with songs, pipes, and flutes,
led the way to this expedition, contrived and managed
by this courtesan, Thais, who, next after the
king, threw the first firebrand into the palace. This
precedent was presently followed by the rest. The
fire once raised, there was no stopping it; but
Alexander soon repented what was doing, and gave
orders for extinguishing it; but this being too late,
the palace was burned, and remains now nearly in the
same state it was left at the conclusion of the fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>According to Arrian, Alexander burned the palace
of the Persian king much against the will of Parmenio,
who exhorted him to leave it untouched. To
which Alexander answered, that he was resolved to
revenge the ancient injuries, Greece had received
from the Persians; who, when they marched into
Greece, burned its <i>temples</i>, and committed many other
barbarous devastations.</p>

<p>This, we think, is one reason why the building
burned must have been a temple, and not a palace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
The Persians had burned the <i>temples</i> of Greece, therefore
Alexander burned the <i>temple</i> of the Persians.
Besides, as the feast was held in the palace, it is not
very likely that the master of the feast should have
burned the place, in which he was not only then feasting,
but in which he was to sleep on the very night
of the conflagration; and that it was not destroyed
is evident from the circumstance, recorded by Strabo
and Arrian&mdash;that Alexander inhabited the royal
palace at Persepolis after his return from India.
Added to which, it is certain that there is, at this
time, no appearance or marks of fire on any part of
the ruins.</p>

<p>In respect to these ruins, it has been well observed,
that magnificent columns, portals, and other architectural
decorations, mark this spot as the site of a
splendid &#8220;palace;&#8221; while the style of the sculptures
and the inscriptions, many of them in the single-headed
character, found only at this place, Nineveh,
Babylon, Susa, and Ván, proves them to be of a very
high antiquity. Mr. Kinneir, however, says they
are generally admitted to be the remains of the
&#8220;palace,&#8221; destroyed by Alexander; and the striking
resemblance of the building, as it exists, to the account
given of Persepolis by Diodorus, is, in his
opinion, sufficient to remove any doubt, that may
exist upon the subject. We confess that such is not
our impression.</p>

<p>Those who regard the ruins as being the remains
of a Persian temple, insist that the sculptured subjects,
as well as the style of architecture, resemble,
in many particulars, those of Egypt: among which
may be mentioned the figures, divided by trees, the
sphinxes, the vases and chains, the domes and architraves,
the subterranean passages in the tombs, the
sarcophagi and urns, and the well, twenty-five feet
deep and fifteen square. The sculpture at Persepolis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
was also painted mostly in blue, a favourite colour in
Egypt; but sometimes in black and in yellow. For
these remarks we are indebted to Mr. Buckingham.</p>

<p>According to Arrian, it was the <i>castle</i> of Persepolis
which Alexander burned. In Mr. Buckingham&#8217;s
opinion, however, the ruins now seen correspond
neither with those of a palace, nor of a castle; they
were, therefore, according to him, not those of the
edifice burned by Alexander at all; for on all these
remains, as we have before stated, no mark of fire is
to be traced, which could not be the case if this had
been the principal agent used in its destruction.</p>

<p>The opinion, that these ruins are the remains of
the palace, is not on the authority of all history,
but on the assertion merely of Quintus, Curtius and
Diodorus. The whole story as to the burning, is said
to have been copied from a Greek writer, named
Clitarchus<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a>.</p>

<p>Though there are no remains of a city now at Persepolis,
nor in any part of the plain in which it is
situated; certain it is, that the city was not destroyed
by Alexander; for it was a very important place for
many centuries after.</p>

<p>Curtius, therefore, is guilty of an error in saying
that the city was so far from being rebuilt, that
unless the river Araxes ran near it, there are no
signs to guess where it stood; for neither Arrian
nor Strabo, nor even Diodorus, whom Curtius commonly
copies, acquaint us with any thing but the
burning of the palace.</p>

<p>The first book of Maccabees says that there was
a rich temple at Persepolis; and, the second, that
Antiochus Epiphanes determined to pillage it. Alexander,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
therefore, could not have destroyed it; for it
is highly improbable, from the history of those times,
that so laboured and magnificent a work should have
been rebuilt and restored in the short period between
Alexander and the Syrian king; viz.&mdash;160 years.
That prince formed the design of pillaging both
&#8220;a temple,&#8221; and the city.</p>

<p>Though Persepolis long survived the palace of
Jemsheed, its inhabitants are said to have regarded
with unextinguishable hatred the people by whom
they were conquered; and, as if inspired by those
fragments of former glory, with which they were
surrounded, they maintained a character for pride
and courage, that was not entirely subdued, till
several centuries after the Arabians first overran
Persia.</p>

<p>Its subsequent history has been summed up by
Mr. Fraser. &#8220;It was among the earliest conquests of
Ardeshir Babegan; Shepoor II. made it his residence;
Yesdigird I. held his court there; and Hoormuz II.,
who reigned at the close of the sixth century, passed
two months every year in it. In the succeeding age,
however, it ceased to be a royal residence; for
Khoosroo Purveez bestowed the government on one
of his favourites; and it was here that the last of the
Sassanian kings lay concealed, when called to the
throne, <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 632. Twelve years afterwards, it capitulated
to the Mohammedans; but the people, having
slain their foreign governor, were all put to the
sword. The city was ultimately destroyed by
Sumcaneah-u-Dowlan, and the fanatical Arabs, <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span>
982. Such,&#8221; concludes Mr. Fraser, &#8220;is the sketch of
the latter days of Istakhar<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a>, (the only name by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>which the city is recognised by the native Persian
historians); but the question, who was its founder?
and who raised the mighty fabrics, of which the
ruins still astonish the traveller? yet remain unanswered.&#8221;</p>

<p>The authors who have described these ruins are,
Garcias de Silva Figueroa, Pietra de la Valle, Sir
John Chardin, Le Brun, Francklin, Niebuhr,
Morier, Buckingham, Porter, Ouseley, and Fraser.</p>

<p>It has been truly said, that we cannot proceed a
step in Persia, without encountering some monument
of the cruelty of conquerors and of human vicissitudes.
These ruins have been variously described; insomuch
that, had travellers not agreed in respect to
the latitude and longitude, one would be tempted to
suspect, that they had visited different ruins. Our
account will therefore be desultory: for to give a full
and regular one would, without drawings, be of little
available use.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very difficult to give any detailed account of
the ruins of this celebrated place,&#8221; says Mr. Buckingham.
&#8220;There is no temple, as at Thebes, at Palmyra,
or at Balbec, sufficiently predominant over all other
surrounding objects to attract the chief attention,
and furnish of itself sufficient matter for description
and observation. Here, all is broken and detached
fragments, extremely numerous, and each worthy of
attention; but so scattered and disjointed, as to give
no perfect idea of the whole. Its principal feature is,
that it presents an assemblage of tall, slender, and
isolated pillars, and separate door-ways and sanctuaries,
spread over a large platform, elevated, like a
fortification, from the level of the surrounding plain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The works of different travellers, describing these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>ruins,&#8221; says Sir William Ouseley, &#8220;furnish many instances
of extraordinary variation. But this discordance
is not peculiar to those, who have written
accounts of Persepolis. We find that, concerning the
same visible and tangible objects, two, three, and even
four, travellers in other countries have disagreed;&mdash;all
men of considerable ingenuity, and none intending to
deceive.&#8221; Sir William then refers to a passage in
Sir Thomas Herbert&#8217;s Travels. &#8220;Forasmuch as the
remaining figures, or images, are many and different,
and so many, as in two days I was there it was impossible
I could take the full of what I am assured
an expert limner may very well spend twice two
months in, ere he can make a fancy draught; for, to
say the truth, this is a work much fitter for the
pencil than the pen; the rather for that I observe
how that travellers, taking a view of some rare piece
together, from the variety of their fancy, they usually
differ in those observations: so that when they
think their notes are exact, they shall pretermit
something that a third will light upon.&#8221; These
observations were made by Sir Thomas among the
ruins of the city, of which we now are treating.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; says Mr. Fraser, &#8220;can be more striking,
than the appearance of those ruins on approaching
them from the south-west. Placed at the base
of a rugged mountain, on a terrace of mason-work
that might vie with the structures of Egypt, it overlooks
an immense plain, inclosed on all sides by distant
but dark cliffs, and watered by the Kour Ab,
which once supplied a thousand aqueducts. But the
water-courses are dried up; the plain is a morass or
a wilderness; for the great city, which once poured
its population over the wide expanse of Merdusht,
has disappeared, and the grey columns rise in solitary
grandeur, to remind us, that mighty deeds were done
in the days of old.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>The last account of this place we have by an Eastern
writer, is that given by Mirza Jan, in the account he
gives of a journey he made from Shirauz to Isfahan.
&#8220;Beyond the village of Kenarch, about half a parasang,
is a mountain, and at the foot of it an extraordinary
place, wherein are columns and marbles, sculptured
with strange devices and inscriptions, so that
most persons imagine this edifice to have been
constructed before the creation of man.&#8221; This is very
curious; since the sculptures themselves give positive
evidence of his existence.</p>

<p>The following account of these ruins is taken
from Mr. Francklin. &#8220;They are about two days&#8217;
journey from Shiraz, on a rising ground, in a plain,
surrounded by an amphitheatre of mountains. They
occupy a circumference of one thousand four hundred
square yards. The front is six hundred paces
from north to south, and three hundred and ninety
from east to west, and the height of the foundation
from forty to fifty feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;The columns are ascended by a grand staircase
of blue stone, about fifty feet high, the sides embellished
with two immense sphinxes, dressed out with
bead-work. At a small distance from these portals
you ascend another flight of steps leading to the
grand hall of columns. The sides of these stairs are
charged with reliefs of figures holding vessels in their
hands, camels, triumphal cars, horses, oxen, and rams.
At the head of the stair is a relief of a lion seizing
a bull. This stair leads to the great hall of forty
or fifty pillars, in nine rows, of six each; of which
fifteen remain entire, from seventy to eighty feet
high; the diameter at the base twelve feet, and
distance between the columns twenty-two. Their
pedestals are curiously wrought, and little injured, the
shafts fluted to the top, and the capitals adorned
with a profusion of fret-work. East of this, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
remains of a square building, entered by a door of
granite; most of the doors and windows standing of
black marble, highly polished. On the sides of the
doors, at entering, are bas-reliefs of two figures, representing
a man stabbing a goat; a common device
all over the palace. Over another door of the same
apartment are two men, and a domestic behind them,
with an umbrella. At the south-west entrance of
this apartment are two large stone pillars, carved
with four figures in long garments, holding spears
ten feet long. Exclusive of the ancient inscriptions,
in unknown characters, interspersed over these ruins,
there are others, accurately described by Niebuhr.
Behind the hall of the pillars, and close under the
mountains, are remains of a very large building,
with two principal entrances from north-east, and
south-west; the wall divided into several partitions,
ornamented with sculpture, and over its twelve doors
the relief of the lion and bull, as before: and besides
the usual figures, one of a man in long garments,
with a cap turret-formed, seated on a pillar, holding
in his hand a small vessel, and wearing a girdle
round his waist, projecting beyond his clothes, and
under him several lions. Behind this ruin, a considerable
way to the north, up the mountain Rehumut,
are remains of two buildings, of three sides, cut out
of the rock, forty feet high, ascended to by steps,
now destroyed. Two of the sides are loaded with
carvings, as of some religious ceremony, including
the figure last mentioned. Former travellers have
supposed these tombs to be of the kings of Persia;
the natives call it Mujilis Jemsheed, or the Assembly
of king Jemsheed, who resorted hither with his
nobles. Under these reliefs several openings lead to
a dark subterranean passage, of six feet by four, into
the rock. At the foot of this mountain, to the south,
are the remains of windows, like those in other parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
of the palace; and, a little westward from it, a stone
staircase, leading to a magnificent square court,
with pediments, and corners of pillars, and on those
ancient inscriptions. In several parts of the palace
are stone aqueducts. These venerable ruins have
suffered from time, weather, and earthquakes; and
are half buried in sand, washed down from the mountains.
Persian writers ascribe it to King Jemsheed;
and the addition of one thousand columns more, to
Queen Homaie, eight hundred years after; but
there is no epoch assigned.&#8221;</p>

<p>This account is from Mr. Francklin; we now
turn to Mr. Morier. &#8220;Tavernier and Des Ferrières-Sauveb&#339;uf,
are the only persons who have spoken
slightingly of these ruins; but there is no small
reason to believe, that the latter never saw the ruins
he speaks of; and that the former merely wrote from
the dubious information of a capuchin, who resided
for some years at Isfahan.&#8221;</p>

<p>Besides the inscriptions, above alluded to, there are
others in Arabic, Persian, and Greek. Dr. Hyde
observes, that the inscriptions are very rude and
clumsy; and that some, if not all, are in praise of
Alexander; and therefore, they must be later than
that conqueror.</p>

<p>The Persepolitan capitals convey the idea of rich
silks and feathers having been tied round the upper
part of tall wooden posts; and rich silks, feathers,
and precious stones, have always been the materials
with which Eastern monarchs form their most gorgeous
decorations.</p>

<p>These ruins bear incontrovertible evidence of
antiquity; and although in some things they resemble
Egyptian, and in others Indian edifices, they, especially
in the palace, possess leading features, sufficiently distinct
to entitle them to be considered as of a separate
school. Yet, being, amongst numerous palaces,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
the only vestiges of lofty stone columns and numerous
sculptures, and being traced immediately subsequent
to the Egyptian expedition under Cambyses, they
afford strong grounds for believing, that Thebaid
influence, by example, or workmen, or both, led to
these works, so unlike what had formerly been practised
in Persia. That the style was not spread over
the empire, may be accounted for from its immediate
subjugation by the Greeks. In latter times the use
of the Gothic arches, and Turkish domes, highly
ornamented, have been, throughout all Persia, extensively
introduced in their palaces, mosques, and
tombs. The hand of the Musselman has likewise
reached the remotest quarters of India<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a>.</p>

<p>The materials, of which the palace is composed, are
chiefly hard blue stone; but the doors and windows
are of black marble, and so beautifully polished, that
they reflect objects like a mirror. This high polish
is agreeably alluded to in the account, given by Mr.
Murray, in his historical account of travels in Asia,
where he mentions that those ruins were visited by
Garcias de Sylva in 1621. &#8220;The ambassador came
to the spot called Cilminar, celebrated for the mighty
ruins which cover its site&mdash;the remains of the ancient
Persepolis. They were diligently surveyed by our
author, who describes them with an enthusiasm,
which perhaps betrays him into some degree of exaggeration.
He dwells on the superb range of columns,
particularly those called the Forty Minarets; the
magnificent stairs by which they are ascended; the
vast interior square, four hundred and thirty feet by
three hundred and ten, and the huge pieces of marble,
without any apparent juncture. The sculptures were
innumerable, and are conceived by him to represent
the actions of a race of men prior to any now known,
even to the ancient Babylonians and Persians. Yet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>though ascending to this vast antiquity, they are so
entire, that, with the exception of a few fragments
broken off, they might seem to have been recently
finished. In comparing these with the monuments
of other nations, he observes, that the pyramids are
mere artificial mountains; while the temples of Greece
are in ruins; here only art and grandeur are united
in pristine perfection. The high polish of the marble
was amusingly shown by a mastiff, who, seeing his
own figure reflected on the walls, was worked up to
fury, which was always increased by the view of the
corresponding gestures in the reflected image; till
the scene being repeated whenever they came, they
were at length obliged to chain and send him off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In some places,&#8221; says Mr. Fraser, &#8220;the number
of sculptures is so great, that they bewilder the eye.
Those figures, which are disposed in groups to suit
the compartments, are variously habited and employed.
Some resemble royal guards and attendants,
clothed in long robes, with brogue-like buskins, and
fluted flat-topped caps, bearing bows and quivers,
shields and spears. Others are placed in long rows,
and appear to represent a procession of many nations,
being differently dressed and appointed. They bear
gifts and offerings, and lead animals of various sorts.
Animals stand on a pedestal, which elevates them
five feet. Their heads are so mutilated, that it is
impossible to say what they were meant to represent;
their necks are decorated with collars of roses; short
curled hair covers the chest, back, and ribs; and the
workmanship is singularly correct and delicate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Almost every one in this procession holds in his
hand a figure like the lotos; a flower full of meaning
to the ancients. That the Persians offered horses to
the sun, and oxen to the moon, is fully shown by this
procession.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Though, at first sight,&#8221; says Sir Robert Porter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
&#8220;I acknowledge that a general similitude to the
Egyptian contour strikes the mind; yet the impression
gradually wears away when the details are
examined; the finishing of the parts, and the grace
and truth of the bas-reliefs, every where proclaiming
the refined taste and master chisels of Greece. When
comparing the colossal proportions of the structure,
and its gigantic sculptures, with the delicacy, beauty,
and perfection of the execution of its ornaments, I
might say, with the poet, &#8216;Here the Loves play on
the bosom of Hercules.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Robert Porter supposes that these works of art
were designed to perpetuate the memory of the grand
religious procession of Cyrus the Great, described by
Xenophon; or, probably, that of Darius, at the festival
of the Noo Roz, or vernal equinox, receiving
presents from the numerous nations of his vast
empire.</p>

<p>&#8220;The numerous basso-relievos,&#8221; says a celebrated
French geographer, &#8220;are highly valuable, as illustrating
the ancient costumes and manners of the
Persians. Those carved on the walls of the staircase
are numerous, exhibiting trains of Persian subjects
from the different parts of the kingdom, bringing
presents to the sovereign, led forward in small parties
by officers of the court, acting as masters of the
ceremonies. In other parts are figures of the king on
his throne; and over him a symbolical representation
of him in the form of a genius, or celestial type of
the earthly potentate; conformable to the views inculcated
by the ancient Persian religion. Guards of
different descriptions are also delineated; and animals,
partly exaggerated and symbolical, and partly
fair representations of nature, contribute to the
effect of lively and extended ornament. Battles,
single combats, and other incidents in the Persian
history, are here, as well as in the other Persian relics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
of antiquity, represented sometimes by symbols, and
sometimes according to nature.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Morier says, that though Le Brun and Chardin
have given only one line of figures on the right of the
staircase, he thought it was evident that there must
have been the same number on the left as there are
on the right. He, therefore, hired some labourers
from the surrounding villages to dig; when, to his
great delight, a second row of figures was discovered,
highly preserved, the details of whose faces, hair,
dresses, arms, and general character, seemed but as
the work of yesterday. There is this distinction,
however, between the two rows:&mdash;the faces of all the
figures to the right of the staircase are mutilated;
those of the newly-discovered ones are quite perfect;
and this shows that they must have been covered
before the invasion of the Saracens: for to that people
is attributed the mutilation of all the figures.</p>

<p>Le Brun counted one thousand three hundred
figures of men and animals, the half of which were
as large as life, without including those on the tombs;
and he counted the fragments of no less than two
hundred and five columns. Destruction, however,
is going on very rapidly. In one part of the remains
there were twenty-five pillars standing, where now
there are only thirteen. Thus,</p>

<p>Mr. Morier says, that on comparing Le Brun&#8217;s, Chardin&#8217;s,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
and Niebuhr&#8217;s drawings with the sculptures, he
found them in general correct in outline, but imperfect
in details of dress, arms, &amp;c.; and that although the
figures are in themselves ill-proportioned, inelegant,
and deficient in anatomical drawing, they are exceedingly
interesting in general character, and have
not been done justice to in the works of these travellers.
They, moreover, furnish the best models of
what were the nations, that invaded Greece with
Xerxes, and that were subdued by Alexander.</p>

<p>The Hall of Pillars appears to have been detached
from the rest of the palace, and to have had a communication
with the other parts by hollow galleries
of stone. It is situated on an eminence, commanding
an extensive view of the plain of Merdusht. It is
strikingly grand, and conveys to the beholder the
idea of a hall of audience of a powerful and warlike
monarch.</p>

<p>The Palace of Forty Pillars (called Shehel Setoon)
was the favourite residence of the latter Sophi kings.
The front is entirely open to the garden, and it is
sustained by a double range of columns, upwards of
forty feet high, each column shooting up from the
united backs of four lions of white marble. The
exhaustless profusion of the splendid materials, of
which this palace is internally formed, which reflect
their own golden or crystal lights on each other,
along with all the variegated colours of the garden,
give the appearance of an entire surface, formed of
polished silver and mother-of-pearl set with precious
stones; a scene well fitted for an Eastern poet&#8217;s
dream, or some magic vision in the tales of an Arabian
Night.</p>

<p>This hall, travellers suppose to be the precise part,
which formed the banqueting-hall where Alexander
displayed his triumph; the place where the kings of
Persia received the homage of their subjects, displayed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
their magnificence, and issued their beneficent
orders; also the private palace which was
appropriated to the domestic intercourse of the members
of the royal family.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Porter says that he gazed at the ruins
with wonder and delight. &#8220;Besides the admiration
which the general elegance of their form, and the
exquisite workmanship of their parts excited,&#8221; says
he, &#8220;I never was made so sensible of the impression
of perfect symmetry, comprising also in itself that of
perfect beauty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Morier says, that on one of the highest columns
is the remains of the sphinx, so common in all the
ornaments of Persepolis; that he could distinguish
on the summit of every one a something quite unconnected
with the capitals; so that the high columns
have, strictly speaking, no capitals whatever, being
each a long shaft to the very summit on which the
sphinx rests. The capitals, he continues, of the
lower columns are of a complicated order, composed
of many pieces. There are also three distinct species
of base.</p>

<p>Deslandes imagined, that these columns never supported
a roof, but idols: on which Porter says, &#8220;I
am not aware of a precedent in any idolatrous country,
for such a wilderness of gods as we should have
found assembled here in effigy; and, least of all,
could we expect to find such extravagant proofs of
polytheism in a palace, that appears to have owed its
origin to the immediate ancestors of Cyrus, the
simple worshippers of Mithra, or the sun; and the
proudest decorations of which may be dated from
Darius, the follower of the philosophic Zoroaster,
whose image, the god of his idolatry, is nothing
grosser than the element of fire. To suppose these
pillars to have been the supports of commemorating
statues to the honour of the heroes of Persia, seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
equally untenable; for it is not in absolute monarchies,
as in republics, or in commonwealths, where
kings form only one great member of the body
politic, that the eminent warriors and worthies of
the land have such monuments erected to them. In
Persia we find the bas-reliefs of its kings and their
attendants on the walls of its palaces; in Rome we
find the statues of Brutus, and Cato, and Cicero,
under the ruins of the forum.&#8221;</p>

<p>In regard to the magnificent colonnade, which
occupies the terrace, &#8220;the imagination,&#8221; says Mr.
Fraser, &#8220;cannot picture a sight more imposing than
those vast, solitary, mutilated pillars, which, founded
in an age beyond the reach of tradition, have
witnessed the lapse of countless generations, and
seen dynasties and empires rise, flourish, and decay,
while they still rear their grey heads unchanged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On ascending the platform, on which the palace
of Chehelminar once stood,&#8221; says Porter, &#8220;nothing
can be more striking than the view of its ruins: so
vast and magnificent, so fallen, mutilated and silent;
the court of Cyrus, and the scene of his bounties;
the pavilion of Alexander&#8217;s triumph, and, alas! the
awful memorial of the wantonness of his power.
But every object, when I saw it, was beautiful as
desolate; amidst the pleasing memories of the past,
awakening poignant regret, that such noble works of
ingenuity should be left to the desert alone; that the
pile of indefatigable labour should be destined, from
the vicissitudes of revolution, and the caprice, ignorance,
or fanaticism of succeeding times, to be left in
total neglect; or, when noticed, doomed to the
predatory mallet, and every other attack of unreflecting
destruction.&#8221;</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable features of these ruins
are the beds of aqueducts which are cut into the
solid rock. The great aqueduct is discovered among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
a confused heap of stones, almost adjoining to the
ruined staircase. In some places it is so narrow,
that a man is obliged to crawl through; in others it
enlarges, so that he can stand upright in it.</p>

<p>Sir William Ouseley says, that he did not perceive
among these monuments of antiquity, which the
Takht exhibits: 1, any object appearing to be a
vestige of the Arsacidan kings; 2, nor any vestige
of the Sassanian dynasty, except two inscriptions;
3, nor any representation of a crooked sword; 4, nor
any human figure with a full face; 5, nor any human
figure mounted on horseback; 6, nor any figure of
a woman; 7, nor any sculpture representing ships,
or alluding to naval or marine affairs; 8, nor any
arches; 9, nor any human figure sitting cross-legged,
or resting on the knees and heels, according
to modern usage in Persia; 10, nor any human figure
in a state of nudity; 11, nor any vestiges either of
wood or of brick; 12, nor any remains of gilding;
13, nor any insulated statue, or sculptured figure,
separated from the general mass of marble, and
showing in full relief the entire form of any object.
Nor did he see any figure, that has ever actually
been an object of idolatrous veneration. &#8220;The
reader will easily believe,&#8221; says Sir William, &#8220;this
catalogue of negative remarks might have been
considerably augmented, when he considers the great
extent of these stupendous ruins; the seeming anomalies
of their plan; the extraordinary style of their
architecture; the labyrinths or narrow passages,
which have been excavated with much art in the
adjacent mountains, and of which no traveller has
yet ascertained either the termination or the mysterious
design; the multiplicity of ornamental devices
in the ruins; and, above all, of the human figures
which their sculptures exhibit.</p>

<p>&#8220;That I have not exaggerated the wonders of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
Jemsheed&#8217;s throne,&#8221; continues this accomplished
traveller and scholar, &#8220;will be evident, on a reference
to the accounts, given by most respectable persons
of various countries, who, in different ages, have
visited its ruins. Not only youthful travellers,
glowing with lively imaginations; but those of sober
judgment, matured by the experience of many years,
seem, as they approach the venerable monuments, to
be inspired by the genius of Eastern romance; and
their respective languages scarcely furnish epithets
capable of expressing with adequate energy the
astonishment and admiration, excited by such a
stupendous object.&#8221; The learning, which Sir William
has expended upon Persepolis and other cities of the
East, is astonishing.</p>

<p>In regard to a portion of a platform, another
traveller says:&mdash;&#8220;To me it seemed to tell its
own story; lying like the buried body of the last
Darius under the ruins of his capital, and speaking
with a voice from the grave; crying, in the words
of Euripides over the like desolation; &#8216;Oh woe,
woe, woe! my country lost! and thou, boast of my
noble ancestors, how art thou shrunk;&mdash;how art thou
vanished!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>There are no appearances now either of a city,
or a citadel, in any direction, about Persepolis.
Three quarters of a mile from Persepolis is the
tomb of the Persian hero, Rustum;&mdash;four chambers
hollowed out in the rock, adorned with the altar of
fire, the sun, and a mystic figure. Under the
sculpture of the second chamber is a gigantic equestrian
figure, very perfect, with others kneeling before
him, and seeming to seize his hand. On one side of
this is an inscription in ancient characters, different
from those at Persepolis.</p>

<p>A little to the north, at the foot of the rock, are
two more figures of horsemen contending for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
ring, and under the horses&#8217; feet two human heads,
besides other attendants. Both these horses are
called Rustum, whose tomb is shown near the foot
of the rock,&mdash;a square building, of blue stone,
twenty feet high, with windows and niches.</p>

<p>In part of the rock to the east is a mutilated
equestrian figure, with a horn on the left side of his
forehead, called Iskunder zu el Kemeen, or Alexander,
Lord of horns<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a>.</p>

<p>In regard to the excavations, Mr. Kinneir is disposed
to believe, that they could have been applied
to no other use than as receptacles for the dead.
The city continued to rank among the first cities of
the empire, until the Mahomedan conquest, and was
the burial place of many of the Sassanian kings.</p>

<p>The body of Yesdigird, the last of that powerful
race, was transported from the distant province of
Khorassan, to be interred at Persepolis, or rather,
perhaps, in the cavities of Nuckshi Rustum.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our first, and, indeed, lasting impressions,&#8221; says
Mr. Morier, &#8220;were astonishment at the immensity,
and admiration at the beauties, of the ruins. Although
there was nothing in the architecture of the buildings,
or in the sculptures and reliefs on the rocks,
which could bear a critical comparison with the
delicate proportions and perfect statuary of the
Greeks; yet, without trying Persepolis by a standard
to which it never was amenable, we yielded at
once to emotions the most lively and the most
enraptured<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a>.&#8221;</p>

<h2>NO. XV.&mdash;PETRA (WADY MOUSA).</h2>

<p>The whole land of Idumea, now a mountainous
rocky desert, was vaguely known to be full of remains
of ancient grandeur and magnificence; but
the country is inhabited by fierce and intractable
tribes of Arabs, who seem to have inherited the
spirit of their forefathers, and to proclaim to approaching
travellers, as the Edomites did to the
children of Israel&mdash;&#8220;Thou shall not pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The evidence,&#8221; says Mons. De la Borde, &#8220;collected
by Volney distinctly shows, that the Idumeans were a
populous and powerful nation, long posterior to the
delivery of the remarkable prophecies concerning
them, recorded in Scripture; that they possessed a
settled government; that Idumea contained many
cities; that these cities have long been absolutely
deserted; that Idumea was eminent as a commercial
nation; and that it offered a much shorter route to
India from the Mediterranean, than the one ordinarily
adopted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Petra lies almost in a line between the Dead Sea
and the gulf of Akaba, at the head of the Red Sea.
&#8220;At what period of time it was founded it is impossible
to determine<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a>. From the mention of its
inhabitants, the Edomites or Idumeans, in scriptural
history, as well as from the character of its monuments,
it is evident, however, that the city must be
of immense antiquity. The Edomites had command
of ports on the Red Sea, which put the commerce of
India and Ethiopia into their hands, and was the
source, both at an early period of their history and
in the time of the Roman empire, of all their greatness.
Petra was the centre point where the caravans
rested between the Asiatic seas and the Mediterranean.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
The book of Job, a work of great antiquity, proves
distinctly the great prosperity of his countrymen, the
Edomites, and their acquaintance with many civilised
arts. From it we learn that they wrought
mines, manufactured wire-brass, and coined money;
that they possessed mirrors, used scales and the
weaver&#8217;s shuttle, and had many musical instruments;
and, finally, that they were well advanced in astronomy
and natural history, and had correct notions
of a Deity and a future state. They also cut inscriptions
on tablets, and their rich men built splendid
tombs. All these things betokened no mean degree
of civilisation in the land of Edom at a very early
date, and confirm the supposition that portions of
the remains of Petra are among the oldest, if not
really the oldest, existing monuments of man&#8217;s
hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Vincent<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> says, &#8220;Petra is the capital of Edom,
or Seir, the Idumea, or Arabia Petræa of the
Greeks, the Nabotæa, considered by geographers, historians,
and poets, as the source of all the precious
commodities of the East.&#8221; The whole commerce of
the East, indeed, originally passed through Arabia
Petræa to Ph&#339;nicia, Tyre, and Egypt. &#8220;Notwithstanding,&#8221;
continues Dr. Vincent, &#8220;that the caravans
decreased in proportion to the advance of navigation,
still Petra was a capital of consideration in the age
of the Periplus; there was still a proportion of the
trade passed from Leukè Komè (the white village)
to this city, and its princes maintained a rank similar
to that of Herod in Judæa. In all the subsequent
fluctuations of power, some commercial transactions
are discoverable in this province; and if Egypt
should ever be under a civilised government again,
Petræa would be no longer a desert.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Nabatæi,&#8221; says Pliny, &#8220;inhabited a city
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>called Petra, in a hollow somewhat less than two
miles in circumference, surrounded by inaccessible
mountains, with a stream running through it. It is
distant from the town of Gaza, on the coast, six
hundred miles, and from the Persian Gulf, one hundred
and twenty-two.&#8221;</p>

<p>Strabo says, &#8220;the capital of the Nabatæi is called
Petra; it lies in a spot, which is itself level and plain,
but fortified all round with a barrier of rocks and
precipices; within, furnished with a spring of excellent
quality, for the supply of water, and the
irrigation of gardens; without the circuit, the country
is in a great measure desert, especially towards
Judæa.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such are the ancient accounts of a city, which,
for many centuries, has been to Europe as if it did
not exist. According to this geographer it was a
great and flourishing city, standing on a high rock in
a plain, hemmed in and fortified all round with a
barrier of rocks and precipices; and from this position
it derived its name.</p>

<p>Very little is known of the history of this remarkable
city, and of this little we have only space for a
few incidents.</p>

<p>When Antigonus had got possession of Syria and
Judæa, he sent one of his generals (Athenæus)
against the people of Petra, because they had made
several inroads into the country, and carried away a
large booty. Athenæus succeeded so far, that he
got possession of the town and likewise all the spoils
deposited in it; but in his retreat the Arabs defeated
his troops, regained all the spoils, and then took repossession
of their city. When they had done this,
they wrote a letter to Antigonus, complaining of the
injustice with which Athenæus had treated them. At
first Antigonus affected to disapprove of Athenæus&#8217;
proceedings; but the moment he could assemble a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
sufficient number of troops, he despatched his son,
Demetrius, into Arabia, with orders to chastise the
Petræans with the utmost severity. This, however,
was easier to be said than done. Demetrius marched
thither, it is true; but as he could not succeed in
taking their city, he found himself compelled to
make the best treaty he could, and march back
again. A further account is given, by another writer:&mdash;&#8220;When
Demetrius<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a>, by order of his father Antigonus,
sate down before Petra with an army, and
began an attack upon it, an Arab accosted him after
the following manner:&mdash;&#8216;King Demetrius: what is it
you would have? What madness can have induced
you to invade a people, inhabiting a wilderness, where
neither corn, nor wine, nor any other thing, you can
subsist upon, are to be found? We inhabit these desolate
plains for the sake of liberty; and submit to
such inconveniences as no other people can bear in
order to enjoy it. You can never force us to change
our sentiments, nor way of life; therefore, we desire
you to retire out of our country, as we have never
injured you; to accept some presents from us; and
to prevail with your father to rank us among his
friends.&#8217; Upon hearing this, Demetrius accepted
their presents, and raised the siege.&#8221;</p>

<p>The city was, in the time of Augustus, the residence
of a monarch, and considered the capital of
Arabia Petræa. The country was conquered by
Trajan, and annexed by him to the province of Palestine.
In more recent times, Baldwin I. king of Jerusalem,
having made himself also master of Petra,
gave it the name of the Royal Mountain.</p>

<p>The probability that the ruins of Wady Mousa
are those of ancient Petra, is thus stated by Colonel
Leake:&mdash;&#8220;The country of the Nabatæi, of which
Petra was the chief town, is well characterised by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
Diodorus as containing some fruitful spots, but as
being, for the most part, desert and waterless. With
equal accuracy, the combined information of Eratosthenes,
Strabo, and Pliny, describes Petra as falling
in a line drawn from the head of the Arabian gulf
(Suez) to Babylon; as being at the distance of three
or four days from Jericho, and of four or five from
Ph&#339;nicon, which was a place now called Moyeleh,
on the Nabatæan coast, near the entrance of the
&AElig;lanitic Gulf; and as situated in a valley of about
two miles in length, surrounded with deserts, inclosed
within precipices, and watered by a river. The latitude
of 30° 20´, ascribed by Ptolemy to Petra, agrees
moreover very accurately with that, which is the
result of the geographical information of Burckhardt.
The vestiges of opulence, and the apparent date of the
architecture at Wady Mousa, are equally conformable
with the remains of the history of Petra found in
Strabo, from whom it appears that, previous to the
reign of Augustus, or under the latter Ptolemies, a
very large portion of the commerce of Arabia and
India passed through Petra to the Mediterranean,
and that <i>armies</i> of camels were required to convey
the merchandise from Leuce Come [Leukè Komè],
on the Red Sea, through Petra, to Rhinocolura, now
El Arish. But among the ancient authorities regarding
Petra, none are more curious than those of
Josephus, Eusebius, and Jerome, all persons well
acquainted with these countries, and who agree in
proving that the sepulchre of Aaron in Mount Hor
was near Petra. From hence it seems evident that
the present object of Mussulman devotion, under the
name of the tomb of Haroun, stands upon the same
spot which has always been regarded as the burying-place
of Aaron; and there remains little doubt, therefore,
that the mountain to the west of Petra is the
Mount Hor of the Scriptures; Mousa being, perhaps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
an Arabic corruption of Movra, where Aaron is
said to have died.&#8221;</p>

<p>Till within these few years, these ruins have been
to Europeans, as if they did not exist. In 1807,
M. Seetzen, travelling under the name of Morse,
made an excursion into Arabia Petræa, as far as
what he calls the frontiers of Idumea, but he did not
approach the ruins of the capital<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a>. The first traveller,
who gave to modern Europe any knowledge of
this city, was Burckhardt. In this journey, made
in the summer of 1812, he encountered many dangers
and difficulties; not so much from the inaccessible
nature of the country, as from the rapacity and prejudices
of the Arabs, who conceive that their ruined
towns are all filled with hidden treasures; and that
European visitors come for the sole purpose of carrying
these away. &#8220;I see now clearly,&#8221; said his guide,
&#8220;that you are an infidel, who have some particular
business among the ruins of the city of our forefathers;
but, depend upon it, we shall not suffer you
to take out a single para of all the treasures hidden
therein; for they are in our territory, and belong to
us.&#8221; With these difficulties, Burckhardt had little
opportunity of doing more than merely ascertaining,
that such ruins as those of Petra did actually
exist. &#8220;I was particularly anxious,&#8221; says he, in
his journal, under date of August 22, &#8220;of visiting
Wady Mousa, of the antiquities of which I had heard
the country people speak in terms of great admiration;
and from thence I had hoped to cross the desert
in a straight line to Cairo; but my guide was afraid
of the hazards of a journey through the desert. I
therefore pretended to have made a vow to slaughter
a goat in honour of Haroun (Aaron), whose tomb I
knew was situated at the extremity of the valley;
and by this stratagem I thought that I should have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>the means of seeing the valley in my way to the
tomb. To this my guide had nothing to oppose; the
dread of drawing upon himself, by resistance, the
wrath of Haroun, completely silenced him.&#8221; Farther
on, speaking of the antiquities of Wady Mousa, the
same traveller says, &#8220;Of these I regret that I am not
able to give a very complete account. I well knew
the character of the people around me. I was without
protection in the midst of a desert, where no traveller
had ever before been seen; and a close examination
of these works of the infidels, as they are
called, would have excited suspicions that I was a
magician in search of treasures. I should at least
have been detained, and prevented from prosecuting
my journey to Egypt, and in all probability should
have been stripped of the little money which I possessed,
and, what was infinitely more valuable to me,
of my journal-book. Future travellers may visit the
spot under the protection of an armed force; the
inhabitants will become more accustomed to the
researches of strangers, and the antiquities of Wady
Mousa will then be found to rank amongst the most
curious remains of ancient art.&#8221;</p>

<p>We shall now give some account of the travels of
Mr. Banks, and the party by whom he was accompanied.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a>
Having quitted the tents of the Bedouins,
with whom they had sojourned for a few days, they
passed into the valley of Ellasar, where they noticed
some relics of antiquity, which they conjectured were
of Roman origin. Here they rested with a tribe of
Arabs. The next day they pursued their journey,
partly over a road paved with lava, and which, by
its appearance, was evidently a Roman work, and
stopped that evening at Shuback, a fortress in a
commanding situation; but incapable, by decay, of
any effectual defence against European tactics.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>
<p>In the neighbourhood of this place they encountered
some difficulties from the Arabs, but which, by
their spirit and firmness, they overcame, and proceeded
unmolested till they reached the tents of a
chieftain called Eben Raschib, who took them under
his protection. This encampment was situated on
the edge of a precipice, from which they had a magnificent
view of Mount Gebel-Nebe-Haroun, the hill
of the prophet Aaron (Mount Hor); and a distant
prospect of Gebel-Tour (Mount Sinai), was also
pointed out to them. In the fore-ground, on the
plain below, they saw the tents of the hostile Arabs,
who were determined to oppose their passage to
Wady Mousa, the ruins of which were also in
sight.</p>

<p>Perceiving themselves thus as it were waylaid,
they sent a messenger to the chief, requesting permission
to pass; but he returned for answer, that
they should neither cross his lands, nor taste his
water. They were in fact in the land of Edom, to
the king of which Moses sent messengers from Kadish.
&#8220;Let us pass,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I pray thee, through thy
country: we will not pass through the fields, or
through the vineyards; neither will we drink of the
waters of the well: we will go by the king&#8217;s highway;
we will not turn to the right hand nor to the
left, until we have passed thy borders.&#8221; But Edom
said unto him, &#8220;Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I
come out against thee with the sword.&#8221;&mdash;Numbers
xx. 17, 18.</p>

<p>The travellers, after some captious negotiation, at
last obtained permission to pass; but not to drink
the waters. They did not, however, very faithfully
observe this stipulation; for on reaching the borders of
a clear bright sparkling rivulet, their horse would taste
the cooling freshness of its waters; and Eben Raschib,
their protector, insisted also that the horses should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
gratified. On crossing this stream they entered on
the wonders of Wady Mousa.</p>

<p>The first object that attracted their attention
was a mausoleum, at the entrance of which stood two
colossal animals; but whether lions or sphinxes they
could not ascertain, as they were much defaced and
mutilated. They then, advancing towards the principal
ruins, entered a narrow pass, varying from
fifteen to twenty feet in width, overhung by precipices,
which rose to the general height of two hundred,
sometimes reaching five hundred feet, and
darkening the path by their projecting ledges. In
some places niches were sculptured in the sides of
this stupendous gallery, and here and there rude
masses stood forward, that bore a remote and mysterious
resemblance to the figures of living things,
but over which, time and oblivion had drawn an
inscrutable and everlasting veil. About a mile
within this pass, they rode under an arch, which
connected the two sides together; and they noticed
several earthen pipes, which had formerly distributed
water.</p>

<p>Having continued to explore the gloomy windings
of this awful corridor for about two miles, the
front of a superb temple burst on their view. A
statue of Victory, with wings, filled the centre of an
aperture in the upper part, and groups of colossal
figures, representing a centaur, and a young man,
stood on each side of the lofty portico. This magnificent
structure is entirely excavated from the solid
rock, and preserved from the ravages of the weather
by the projections of the overhanging precipices.
About three hundred yards beyond this temple, they
met with other astonishing excavations; and, on
reaching the termination of the rock on their left,
they found an amphitheatre, which had also been
excavated, with the exception of the proscenium; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
this had fallen into ruins. On all sides the rocks
were hollowed into innumerable chambers and sepulchres;
and a silent waste of desolated palaces, and
the remains of constructed edifices, filled the area to
which the pass led.</p>

<p>Since this, Captains Irby and Mangles, who
accompanied Mr. Banks, have published an account
of their journey:&mdash;&#8220;Our defile brought us directly
down into the valley of Wady Mousa, whose name
had become so familiar to us. It is, at the point
where we entered it, a stony but cultivated valley, of
moderate size, without much character or beauty,
running in a direction from east to west. A lesser
hollow, sloping down to it from the southward, meets
it at an angle. At the upper end of the latter valley
is the village seen over stages of hanging fruit-grounds,
which are watered by a spring. * * Some hundred
yards below this spring begin the outskirts of the
vast necropolis of Petra. * * As we advanced,
the natural features of the defile grew more and more
imposing at every step, and the excavations and
sculpture more frequent on both sides, till it presented
at last a continued street of tombs, beyond
which the rocks, gradually approaching each other,
seemed all at once to close without any outlet. There
is, however, one frightful chasm for the passage of
the stream, which furnishes, as it did anciently, the
only avenue to Petra on this side (the eastern).</p>

<p>&#8220;It is impossible,&#8221; continues Captain Irby, &#8220;to
conceive any thing more awful and sublime than the
eastern approach to Petra. The width is not more
than just sufficient for the passage of two horsemen
abreast; the sides are in all parts perpendicular,
varying from four hundred to seven hundred feet in
height; and they often overhang to such a degree,
that, without their absolutely meeting, the sky is
intercepted, and completely shut out for one hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
yards together, and there is little more light than in
a cavern.&#8221; This half subterranean passage is more
than two miles in length, and retains throughout
the same extraordinary character.</p>

<p>&#8220;After passing the Khasne, the defile becomes
contracted again for three hundred yards, when suddenly
the ruins of the city burst on the view in their
full grandeur, shut in on the opposite side by barren
craggy precipices, from which numerous ravines and
valleys, like those we had passed, branch out in all
directions. (All of these ravines, however, that
were explored, were found to terminate in a wall of
rock, admitting of no passage outwards or inwards.)
The sides of the mountains, covered with an endless
variety of excavated tombs and private dwellings,
presented altogether the most singular scene we ever
beheld. We must despair to give the reader an idea
of the peculiar effect of the rocks, tinted with most
extraordinary hues, whose summits present us with
Nature in her most savage and romantic form; whilst
their bases are worked out in all the symmetry and
regularity of art, with colonnades and pediments,
and ranges of corridors adhering to the perpendicular
surface.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next party that visited Petra were Messrs.
Laborde and Linant. After traversing Wada Araba,
they entered the Wady Mousa, the &#8220;mysterious
valley of Petra.&#8221; Laborde confesses that, notwithstanding
the perfect good feeling which existed between
the travellers and their conductors, he felt an
indefinable kind of fear that the grand object of their
journey&mdash;the minute investigation of Petra&mdash;might,
after all, be defeated. The &#8220;Fellahs of Wady
Mousa&#8221; were yet to be reconciled to their plan of
operations.</p>

<p>It is a common belief amongst the Arabs, that
immense treasures are buried beneath the ruins that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
strew the rocky desert of Idumea; and it is, of
course, a natural inference, that the object of Europeans
in visiting the country is, by magic or superior
craft, to obtain access to those treasures, the possession
of which belongs to the lords of the soil. But
in drawing near to the city, a danger, says M.
Laborde, on which the travellers had not reckoned,
proved a cause of their security. The plague had
been brought from the shores of the Mediterranean
into the secluded Wady Mousa, and the Fellahs had
fled from its violence. The travellers, during their
inspection of the city, were comparatively free from
annoyance: but they would have staid longer if
their Arab conductors, who were afraid of the plague,
had not teased them to return; and the fact of their
residence in Petra was beginning to spread.</p>

<p>Messrs. Laborde and Linant arrived in Petra from
the south; and on reaching a point from which they
could see the extent of the town, they were struck
with amazement at the immense mass of ruins strewed
around, and the extensive circle of rocks inclosing
the place, pierced with an innumerable quantity of
excavations. In fact, words are inadequate to convey
a clear idea of the ruins of Petra.</p>

<p>In Laborde&#8217;s plan of Petra, the town is exhibited
as completely encircled by huge rocks. These rocks
are excavated in every variety of form. The only
entrance to the town is from the south-west, by the
windings of a narrow ravine, through which flows
the river, or rather stream, of Wady Mousa<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;We wound round a peak,&#8221; says M. Laborde,
&#8220;surmounted by a single tree. The view from this
point exhibited a vast frightful desert; a chaotic sea,
the waves of which were petrified. Following the
beaten road, we saw before us Mount Hor, crowned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>by the tomb of the prophet, if we are to credit the
ancient tradition, preserved by the people of that
country. Several large and ruinous excavations,
which are seen in the way, may arrest the attention
of a traveller who is interested by such objects, and
has no notion of those, still concealed from his view
by the curtain of rocks which extends before him;
but at length the rock leads him to the heights above
one more ravine; whence he discovers within his
horizon the most singular spectacle, the most enchanting
picture, which Nature has wrought in her
grandest mood of creation; which men, influenced by
the vainest dreams of ambition, have yet bequeathed
to the generations that were to follow them. At
Palmyra, Nature renders the works of man insignificant
by her own immensity and her boundless
horizon, within which some hundreds of columns
seem entirely lost. Here, on the contrary, she seems
delighted to set, in her most noble frame-work, his
productions, which aspire, and not unsuccessfully, to
harmonize with her own majestic, yet fantastic, appearance.
The spectator hesitates for a moment, as
to which of the two he is the more impelled to
admire; whether he is to accord the preference to
Nature, who invites his attention to her matchless
girdle of rocks, wondrous as well for their colour as
their forms; or to the men who feared not to mingle
the works of their genius with such splendid efforts
of creative power.&#8221;</p>

<p>We now give an abstract of what has been written
of this city, mainly taken from a very intelligent periodical
journal, published at Edinburgh (Chambers&#8217;s
Journal).</p>

<p>Nearly at the spot where the defile opens into the
site of the city, one excavation in the site of the pass
arrests the attention of the traveller. This is a vast
circular theatre hewn out of the solid rock, consisting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
of thirty-three seats of stone sloping upwards, and
surmounted, and in some degree sheltered, by the
rocks above. The countless tombs in the immediate
vicinity of this ruined edifice led M. Laborde to remark
on the extraordinary taste of the people of
Petra, in selecting a place of amusement, encircled on
all sides by the mansions and memorials of death!</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to enter into a minute description
of the excavated tombs and sepulchres, studding
the rocky walls around Petra. The basis of the architecture,
in almost all cases, is Grecian, mingled with
Roman; though in many instances a style is apparent,
which must be regarded as Egyptian, or rather the
native style of Petra. Many of the chambers within
the tombs are so immense, that their real character
might be doubted; were it not for the recesses they
contain, destined, it is plain, for the reception of
bodies. How enormous must have been the labour
and expense, necessary for the excavation of these
sepulchres, some of which are large enough to stable
the horses of a whole tribe of Arabs! It is impossible
to conceive that such resting-places could have been
appropriated to any other persons than rulers or
rich men, and great, indeed, as Mr. Burckhardt
remarks, &#8220;must have been the opulence of a city,
which could dedicate such monuments to the memory
of its rulers.&#8221; Some of the finest mausoleums, as we
have already seen, are not in the main valley, but in
the ravines leading from it, where their multiplicity
is beyond conception. In a ravine on the north-west,
M. Laborde beheld one, called by the natives El-Deir,
or the Convent, of much larger dimensions than
the Khasne, and, like it, sculptured out of the rock,
though not in a style so perfect.</p>

<p>As the visitor advances into the area, he beholds
in front of him one of the most splendid and beautiful
objects in or around Petra, and what may justly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
be called one of the wonders of antiquity. This is
the front of a great temple, nearly sixty-five feet in
height, excavated from the solid rock, and embellished
with the richest architectural decorations, all
in the finest state of preservation. Six pillars, thirty-five
feet high, with Corinthian capitals, support an
ornamented pediment, above which stand six smaller
pillars, the centre pair crowned by a vase, and surrounded
by statues and other ornaments. Mere
description can do no justice to this building. Near
it stands a magnificent triumphal arch.</p>

<p>This temple is termed by the Arabs &#8220;<i>Khasne Pharaon</i>,&#8221;&mdash;Pharaoh&#8217;s
treasure; from their supposition
that here are hidden those stores which they have
vainly sought for elsewhere. In the sarcastic words
of M. Laborde, &#8220;It was quite in accordance with
their character, after having fruitlessly spoiled the
monuments inclosed in the tombs, to seek the spot
where the constructor of such magnificent edifices had
deposited his treasure. That spot they supposed they
had found at last&mdash;it was the urn which may be distinguished
on the top of the monument. This must
contain all the riches of the great king;&mdash;but, unhappily,
it is out of their reach, and only taunts their
desire. Consequently, each time that they pass
through the ravine, they stop an instant, fire at the
urn, and endeavour to break it, in the hope of bringing
it down and securing the treasure. Their efforts
are fruitless; and they retire murmuring against the
king of Giants, who has so adroitly placed his treasure
120 feet above their reach.&#8221;</p>

<p>The temple is hewn in an enormous and compact
block of freestone, which is lightly coloured with
oxide of iron. Its high state of preservation is owing
to the shelter which the surrounding rocks afford it
against the wind, and also in preserving the roof from
the rain. The only traces of deterioration are in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
statues at the base of the column, which has been
produced by the humidity undermining the parts
most in relief, or nearest to the ground. To the same
cause may be attributed the fall of one of the columns
which was attached to the front. Had the structure
been built instead of being hewn, the fall of this
column would have dragged down the entire building.
As it is, it merely occasions a void, which does not destroy
the effect of the whole. &#8220;It has even been useful,&#8221;
says M. Laborde, &#8220;in so far as it enabled us, by
taking its dimensions, to ascertain the probable height
of the temple, which it would otherwise have been impossible
to do with precision.&#8221; He calls the temple
&#8220;one of the wonders of antiquity,&#8221; and apologises for
the expression in the following manner:&mdash;&#8220;We are
apt, doubtless, to charge the traveller with exaggeration
who endeavours, by high-sounding eulogiums,
to enhance the merit of his fatigues, or the value of
his labours: but here, at least, plates designed with
care will establish the truth of a description which
might otherwise appear extravagant.&#8221;</p>

<p>The interior of the temple does not fulfil the expectations,
created by the magnificence of the exterior.
Several steps conduct to a room, the door of which
is perceived under the peristyle. &#8220;Although the
chamber is hewn regularly, and is in good proportion,
the walls are rough, its doors lead to nothing, and
the entire appears to have been abandoned while the
work was yet in progress. There are two lateral
chambers, one of which is irregular, and the other
presents two apertures, which seem to have been
hewn for two coffins.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Irby speaks of this temple in the following
manner: &#8220;The position is one of the most
beautiful that could be imagined for the front of a
great temple, the richness and exquisite finish of
whose decorations offer a most remarkable contrast to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
the savage scenery that surrounds it. It is of a very
lofty proportion, the elevation comprising two stories.
The taste is not exactly to be commended; but many
of the details and ornaments, and the size and proportion
of the great doorway especially, to which
there are five steps of ascent from the portico, are very
noble. No part is built, the whole being purely a
work of excavation; and its minutest embellishments,
wherever the hand of man has not purposely effaced
and obliterated them, are so perfect, that it may be
doubted whether any work of the ancients, excepting,
perhaps, some on the banks of the Nile, have
come down to our time so little injured by the lapse
of ages. There is, in fact, scarcely a building of
forty years&#8217; standing in England so well preserved in
the greater part of its architectural decorations. Of
the larger members of the architecture nothing is deficient,
excepting a single column of the portico; the
statues are numerous and colossal.&#8221;</p>

<p>The brook of Wady Mousa, after leaving the eastern
defile by which it entered, passes directly across the
valley, and makes its exit by a rocky ravine on the
west, almost impassable by the foot of man. On the
banks of this stream are situated the principal ruins
of the city. There, at least, are found those in chief
preservation&mdash;for, properly speaking, the whole valley
may be said to be covered with ruins.</p>

<p>The remains of paved-ways, bridges, and other
structures, may still be seen among the other ruins of
the valley. Not the least interesting object, observable
in the vale, is the aqueduct which is continued
from the eastern approach along the face of the rocks
constituting the eastern wall of this city. This aqueduct
is partly hewn and partly built, and is yet in a
very perfect condition.</p>

<p>The only inscriptions, hitherto discovered at Petra,
are two which M. Laborde met with on tombs. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
of these, in Greek characters, was so much mutilated
as to be unreadable, and the other, a Latin one, notified
that a certain Roman consul died at Petra, when
governor of Arabia.</p>

<p>The only living being found residing in the immediate
neighbourhood of the ruins, with the exception
of the reptiles that infest the excavations, was a
decrepit old man, who had lived for forty years on
the top of Mount Hor, an eminence at the west of
Petra, where a tomb, said to be that of Aaron, is
seen. The wandering Arabs, who revere the Jewish
traditions, hold this place as sacred, and support its
old guardian by occasional pilgrimages and contributions<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>For want of space we must here close our account;
referring for a more enlarged knowledge of this celebrated
&#8220;city of the desert,&#8221; to the travels of Burckhardt,
Captains Irby and Mangles, and MM. Laborde
and Linant. The following references lead to some of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>the passages, in which the fate of this city was foretold
by the sacred writers<a name="FNanchor_96_105" id="FNanchor_96_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_105" class="fnanchor">96</a>.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;I will stretch out mine hand upon Edom, and will cut off

<h2>NO. XVI.&mdash;PHIGALIA.</h2>

<p>This was a town of Arcadia, called after Phigalus.
Bacchus and Diana had each a temple there, and the
public places were adorned with the statues of illustrious
natives. &#8220;In the forum,&#8221; says Anacharsis,
&#8220;is a statue which might serve for the history of
the arts. The feet are almost joined, and the
pendant hands are fastened close to the sides and
thighs; for in this manner were statues formerly
sculptured in Greece, and thus they are still in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
Egypt. It was erected for the athlete Arrhacion,
who gained one of the prizes in the 52nd, 53rd,
and 54th Olympiads. We may hence conclude
that, two centuries before our time, many statuaries
still servilely followed the Egyptian taste.&#8221;</p>

<p>This town was situated on a high and craggy
rock, near Megalopolis. Being the key, as it were,
of Arcadia, the Lacedemonians laid siege to it and
took it 659 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span> In order to regain the city, the
inhabitants consulted the oracle of Delphos, who
directed them to select one hundred men from
Orestasium to assist them. These brave persons
perished; but the Orestasians, in concert with the
Phigalians, attacked their enemies and routed them.
The Phigalians afterwards erected a monument in
honour of the one hundred men who had fallen.</p>

<p>There was one temple dedicated to Diana Conservatrix,
in which was her statue, and another dedicated
to Apollo the Deliverer.</p>

<p>Chandler relates, that M. Joachim Bocher, an
architect of Paris, was desirous of examining a building
near Caritena. He was still remote from that
place, when he perceived a ruin, two hours from
Verrizza, which prevented him from going further.
This ruin stands on an eminence, sheltered by lofty
mountains. The temple, it is supposed, was that of
Apollo Epicurius, near Phigalia. It was of the
Doric order, and had six columns in front. The
number which ranged round the cella was thirty-eight.
Two at the angles are fallen; the rest are
entire, in good preservation, and support their architraves.
Within them lies a confused heap. The
stone inclines to grey, with reddish veins. To its
beauty is added great precision in the workmanship.
These remains had their effect, striking equally the
mind and the eye of the beholder.</p>

<p>The walls of Phigalia alone remain; they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
flanked with towers, both square and circular. One
gate towards the east is yet covered by blocks, which
approach each other like the underside of a staircase.
There has been a temple, of fine limestone, of
the Doric order, on which is an inscription.</p>

<p>Pausanias describes Phigalia as surrounded by
mountains, of which one named <i>Cotylium</i> was distant
about forty stadia, or five miles. The temple of
Apollo stood on this, at a place called Bassæ.</p>

<p>Under the ruins of this temple, the Baron Von
Stachelberg discovered, in 1812, some curious bas-reliefs,
which are now in the British Museum.
They were executed in the time of Pericles, the
temple having been built by Ictinus, the architect of
the Parthenon.</p>

<p>These bas-reliefs, representing the battle of the
Centaurs and Lapithæ, and the combat between
the Greeks and Amazons, composed the frieze in
the interior of the cella, in the temple of Apollo the
Deliverer. The battle of the Centaurs and Lapithæ is
sculptured on eleven slabs of marble; that of the
Greeks and Amazons occupies twelve.</p>

<p>Besides these there are other fragments from the
same temple:&mdash;1. A fragment of a Doric capital of
one of the columns of the peristyle. 2. A fragment
of an Ionic temple of one of the columns of the
cella. 3. Two fragments of the tiles, which
surmounted the pediments, and formed the superior
moulding. 4. Fragments of metopes, found in the
porticos.</p>

<p>The following observations lately appeared in the
Times newspaper:&mdash;&#8220;In the saloon of the British
Museum are the celebrated bas-reliefs, found at Mount
Cobylus, near the ancient city of Phigalia, in Arcadia.
They represent the battles of the Greeks and Amazons,
and those of Theseus and the Lapithæ against the
Centaurs. According to Pausanias, they were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
work of Ictinus, a contemporary of Phidias. The
grandeur of conception displayed in their composition,
the variety of attitude and action shown, is not
surpassed by those in the Elgin saloon, though their
execution may be inferior. The combat of the
Greeks and Amazons occupies twelve slabs of marble,
and that of the Centaurs eleven. Both the history
of the Amazons and the battle, here represented, are
obscure. The origin of the name is derived from
two words, &#8216;Ama&#8217; or &#8216;Ma,&#8217; which in all old languages
signifies &#8216;mother&#8217;&mdash;its ubiquity is proof of
its antiquity&mdash;and the ancient name of the sun, as
found in the Temple of Heliopolis, in Egypt, is
&#8216;On,&#8217; &#8216;Ton,&#8217; or &#8216;Zoan;&#8217; but that any nation of
Amazons, in the vulgar acceptation of the word,
ever existed, is more than problematical. Faber
says that those nations, who worshipped the female
principle of the world, such as the Iberians, the
Cimmerians, the Mootæ, the Atalantians of Mauritania,
and the Ionians, were Amazons, and a celebrated
invasion of Attica by them is mentioned.
We are told that Eumolphus, an Egyptian, was the
leader; and Pausanias mentions an Attic victory or
trophy, called an Amazonium, erected to their manes.
According to Arrian, the Queen of the Amazons, on
the borders of the Caspian Sea, sent ambassadors
with defiance to Alexander. In the time of
Pompey, they were still supposed to exist; and Dion
Cassius says, that in the Mithridatic war buskins
and boots were found by the Roman soldiers,
undoubtedly Amazonian. The worship of the male
and female deities in Greece caused peace between
the sects, and the origin of their quarrel and their
name was forgotten in Europe. In Asia the Persians
and the Jews seem still to have formed an exception.
Cambyses, in his invasion, destroyed in Egypt everything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
connected with the female worship; he overturned
the sphinxes, but he left the obelisks untouched.
The scene of the combat, depicted on these tablets,
is drawn with great force and spirit: some of
the Amazons have long tunics, others short vestments,
only reaching to the knee; one on horseback has
trousers, and loose sleeves reaching to the wrist; on
the head of some is the Archaic helmet, and those
without have the hair fastened in a knot on the top;
they all but one wear boots, which reach to the
knees; their robes are fastened with a zone; some
have two belts crossed between the breasts; their
arms are swords, and the double-headed Scythian
battle-axe, as also spears, bows, and arrows. None
of these last are preserved, they being probably of
bronze, as the holes remain, and added afterwards,
as was the custom with ancient sculpture; the shields
are small, and of the lunar form, opening at top.
The Athenian warriors have cloaks, or tunics,
fastened round the neck, and tightened about the
waist by a belt; it reaches no lower than the knee;
the right arm is bare. In one group a fierce warrior
has seized a mounted Amazon by the hair; he is
dragging her from the horse, which is rearing. The
action of the female figure is very fine: she firmly
maintains her seat, till relieved by another; who,
with uplifted axe and shield to protect her from the
flying arrows, shall have brained her antagonist.
The 18th slab has five figures and two horses; in
one the horse has fallen, and an Athenian warrior
has his right hand fixed on the throat of the Amazon,
while, with the other hand, he has grasped her foot,
and drags her, who seems to have lost all recollection,
from the horse&#8217;s back. The position of the centre
figure is very fine: he is within the guard of the
shield of the Amazon, and is striking a deadly blow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
with his hand, in which has been a sword. In
another group an Athenian has fallen; he rests on
his left hand, and extends his right in supplication
to the female warriors who surround him, and is in
the act of surrendering, while behind him an Amazon
is striking him with her battle-axe. In the sculptures
of the Lapithæ and Centaurs all the warriors,
with the exception of Theseus, are armed with
swords, who, as an imitator of Hercules, has a club.
The shields are large and circular; they have a
broad border round the circumference, and resemble
those of the Ephibi of Athens. Of the helmets there
are four kinds&mdash;one which fits the head closely,
without either crest or vizor; another with a crest,
and one with guards for the ears, and a fourth with
a pointed vizor. In one of the sculptures Theseus is
seen attacking a Centaur; he has the head of the
monster under his left arm, and with the right, which
probably held a club of bronze, as the hole remains,
he is destroying him. He appears to have arrived
just in time to save Hippodomia, whom the
Centaur has disrobed, and who is clinging to the
statue of Diana. From the tiara behind, and the
lion&#8217;s skin, this figure is supposed to be Theseus;
the Centaur is Eurytion; a female figure is also seen
pleading on her behalf, and, in the distance, a Goddess
is hastening in a car drawn by stags to the rescue;
this probably is Diana, as the temple was dedicated
to Apollo.&#8221;</p>

<p>The city of Phigalia is now become a mere village,
known by the name of Paolitza<a name="FNanchor_97_106" id="FNanchor_97_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_106" class="fnanchor">97</a>.</p>

<h2>NO. XVII.&mdash;PLAT&AElig;A.</h2>

<p>This city has long been famous; for it was in a
plain near to it that was fought the celebrated battle
between the Greeks and Persians<a name="FNanchor_98_107" id="FNanchor_98_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_107" class="fnanchor">98</a>. On the evening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>previous to the engagement, the Grecians held a
council of war, in which it was resolved, that they
should decamp from the place they were in, and
march to another more conveniently situated for
water. Night being come on, and the officers endeavouring
at the head of their corps to make more
haste than ordinary to the camp marked out for
them, great confusion happened among the troops,
some going one way and some another, without observing
any order or regularity in their march. At
last they halted near the little city of Platæa.</p>

<p>On the first news of the Grecians being decamped,
Mardonius drew his army into order of battle, and
pursued them with hideous shouting and bawling of
his barbarian forces, who thought they were advancing
not so much in order of battle, as to strip
and plunder a flying enemy; and their general likewise,
making himself sure of victory, proudly insulted
Artabazus; reproaching him with his fearful
and cowardly prudence, and with the false notion, he
had conceived of the Lacedæmonians, who never fled,
as he pretended, before an enemy; whereas here was
an instance of the contrary. But the general found
quickly this was no false or ill-grounded notion. He
happened to fall in with the Lacedæmonians, who
were alone and separated from the body of the Grecian
army, to the number of fifty thousand men,
together with three thousand of the Tegeatæ. The
encounter was exceedingly fierce and resolute on both
sides; the men fought with the courage of lions, and
the barbarians perceived that they had to do with
soldiers, who were determined to conquer or die on
the field. The Athenian troops, to whom Pausanias
sent an officer, were already upon their march to their
aid; but the Greeks who had taken part with the
Persians, to the number of fifty thousand men, went
out to meet them on their way, and hindered them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
from proceeding any farther. Aristides, with his
little body of men, bore up firmly against them, and
withstood their attack, telling them how insignificant
a superiority of numbers is against true courage and
bravery. The battle being thus divided, and fought
in two different places, the Spartans were the first
who broke in upon the Persian forces, and put them
in disorder. Mardonius, their general, falling dead
of a wound he had received in the engagement, all
his army betook themselves to flight; and those
Greeks, who were engaged against Aristides, did the
same thing as soon as they understood the barbarians
were defeated. The latter ran away to their former
camp which they had quitted, where they were
sheltered and fortified with an inclosure of wood.</p>

<p>The manner, in which the Lacedæmonians treated
the Platæans some time after, is, also, not unworthy
of remembrance. About the end of the campaign,
which is that wherein Mitylene was taken, the Platæans,
being in absolute want of provisions, and
unable to make the least defence, surrendered, upon
condition that they should not be punished till they
had been tried and judged in form of justice. Five
commissioners came for that purpose from Lacedæmon;
and these, without charging them for any
crime, barely asked them, Whether they had done
any service to the Lacedæmonians and the allies in
war? The Platæans were much surprised as well as
puzzled at this question, and were sensible that it
had been suggested by the Thebans, their professed
enemies, who had vowed their destruction. They
therefore put the Lacedæmonians in mind of the
services, they had done to Greece in general; both at
the battle of Artemesium, and that of Platæa, and
particularly in Lacedæmonia, at the time of the
earthquake, which was followed by the revolt of
their slaves. The only reason, they declared, of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
having joined the Athenians afterwards, was to
defend themselves from the hostilities of the Thebans,
against whom they had implored the assistance of
the Lacedæmonians to no purpose: that if that was
imputed to them as a crime, which was only their
misfortune, it ought not however entirely to obliterate
the remembrance of their former services. &#8220;Cast
your eyes,&#8221; said they, &#8220;on the monuments of your
ancestors, which you see here, to whom we annually
pay all the honours, which can be rendered to the
manes of the dead. You thought fit to entrust their
bodies with us, as we were eye-witnesses of their
bravery; and yet you will now give up their ashes to
their murderers, in abandoning us to the Thebans,
who fought against us at the battle of Platæa. Will
you enslave a province where Greece recovered its
liberty? Will you destroy the temples of those gods
to whom you owe the victory? Will you abolish the
memory of their founders, who contributed so greatly
to your safety? On this occasion, we may venture
to say, our interest is inseparable from your glory;
and you cannot deliver up your ancient friends and
benefactors to the unjust hatred of the Thebans,
without eternal infamy to yourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>One would conclude, that these just remonstrances
would have made some impression on the Lacedæmonians;
but they were biassed more by the answer
the Thebans made, and which was expressed in the
most bitter and haughty terms against the Platæans,
and, besides, they had brought their instructions from
Lacedæmon. They stood, therefore, to their first
question, &#8220;Whether the Platæans had done them
any service during the war?&#8221; And making them pass
one after another, as they severally answered &#8220;No,&#8221;
each was immediately butchered, and not one escaped.
About two hundred were killed in this manner; and
twenty-five Athenians, who were among them, met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
the same unhappy fate. Their wives, who were
taken prisoners, were made slaves. The Thebans
afterwards peopled their city with exiles from Megara
and Platæa; but, the year after, they demolished the
latter entirely. It was in this manner the Lacedæmonians,
in the hopes of reaping great advantages from
the Thebans, sacrificed the Platæans to their animosity,
ninety-three years after their first alliance with
the Athenians.</p>

<p>Herodotus relates, that cenotaphs, composed of heaps
of earth, were raised near the town; but no vestige of
these remain; nor are there any traces of the sepulchres
of those who fell at Platæa. These are mentioned
by Plutarch, who says, that at the anniversary
of those who were killed at Platæa, the Archon
crossed the city to go to the sepulchres, and drawing
water from the fountain in a vase, washed the columns
of the tombs, and made libations of wine, oil, milk,
and perfumes.</p>

<p>Here was a temple of Minerva, in which Polygnotus
executed a group of the return of Ulysses;
and a statue of the goddess of great size, of gilt wood;
but the face, hands, and feet, were of ivory. Also a
temple of Diana, in which was a monument of
Euchidas, a citizen of Platæa, to commemorate his
having run from Platæa to Delphos, and returned
before sunset: he expired a few minutes after. The
distance was thirty-seven leagues and a half.</p>

<p>Mr. Dodwell says, he could find no certain
traces of this temple, nor of one dedicated to Ceres,
unless several heaps of large stones might be regarded
as such. Neither could he find any remains
of a stadium. He saw, however, a frieze of white
marble, enriched with Ionic ornaments.</p>

<p>Dr. Clarke says, that the upper part of the promontory
is covered with ruins; amidst which he
found some pieces of serpentine porphyry; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
peasants, he says, in ploughing the soil in the neighbourhood,
find their labours frequently obstructed
by large blocks of stone, and earth, filled with
broken remains of terra cottas. The ground-plot
and foundations of temples are visible among the
vestiges of the citadel, and remains of towers are
conspicuous upon the walls.</p>

<p>The walls form a triangle of about three thousand
three hundred yards in compass. In some parts
they are in a high state of preservation, and extremely
interesting; since they were rebuilt in the
reign of Alexander, after having been destroyed by
the Persians. They are of regular masonry, eight
feet in thickness, and fortified by towers, most of
which are square.<a name="FNanchor_99_108" id="FNanchor_99_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_108" class="fnanchor">99</a></p>

<p>The view from the ruins is extremely interesting
and beautiful. &#8220;When we look towards Thebes,&#8221;
says Mr. Dodwell, &#8220;we behold the Asopos, and the
other small streams, winding through this memorable
plain, which, towards the west, is separated by a low
range of hills from the equally celebrated field of Leuctra;
while the distant view is terminated by the two
pointed summits of Helicon, and the snow-topped
heights of Parnassus.&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;What must this city have
been, in all its pride and glory!&#8221; exclaims Mr. Williams.
&#8220;The remains now appear grey as twilight;
but without a charm of returning day. Time is modelling
now, instead of art. Miles of ancient pottery
and tiles, hardly allowing the blades of corn to grow
among the ruins; sheep-tracks among the massive
foundations; asses loaded with brush-wood, from
shrubs growing in the courts of ancient palaces and
temples; shepherds with their flocks, the bells of the
goats heard from among the rocks; tombs and sarcophagi
of ancient heroes, covered with moss, some
broken and some entire; fragments, and ornaments,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>and stones containing mutilated inscriptions;&mdash;these
are the objects, which Platæa now presents. But
who, that stands there, with a recollection of its
ancient glory, and having Parnassus full in view, can
quit the spot without regret?<a name="FNanchor_100_109" id="FNanchor_100_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_109" class="fnanchor">100</a>&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the president Dupaty first beheld Pæstum,
he expressed his admiration in the following manner:&mdash;&#8220;No;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
I am not at Pæstum, in a city of the Sybarites!
Never did the Sybarites choose for their
habitation so horrible a desert; never did they
build a city in the midst of weeds, on a parched
soil, on a spot where the little water to be met with
is stagnant and dirty. Lead me to one of those
groves of roses, which still bloom in the poetry of
Virgil.<a name="FNanchor_102_111" id="FNanchor_102_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_111" class="fnanchor">102</a> Show me some baths of alabaster; some
palaces of marble; show me on all sides voluptuousness,
and you will indeed make me believe I am at
Pæstum. It is true, nevertheless, that it was the
Sybarites who built these three temples, in one of
which I write this letter, seated on the ruins of a
pediment, which has withstood the ravages of two
thousand years. How strange! Sybarites and works
that have endured two thousand years! How could
Sybarites imagine and erect so prodigious a number
of columns of such vile materials, of such uncouth
workmanship, of so heavy a mass, and such a sameness
of form? It is not the character of Grecian
columns to crush the earth; they lightly mounted
into the air; these, on the contrary, weigh ponderously
on the earth; they fall. The Grecian columns
had an elegant and slender shape, around which the
eye continually glided; these have a wide and clumsy
form, around which it is impossible for the eye to
turn: our pencils and our graving-tools, which flatter
every monument, have endeavoured in vain to beautify
them. I am of the opinion of those, who think
that these temples were the earliest essays of the
Grecian architecture, and not its master-pieces. The
Greeks, when they erected these pillars, were searching
for the column. It must be admitted, however,
that, notwithstanding their rusticity, these temples
do possess beauties; they present at least simplicity,
unity, and a whole, which constitute the first of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>beauties: the imagination may supply almost all the
others, but it never can supply these. It is impossible
to visit these places without emotion. I proceed
across desert fields, along a frightful road, far
from all human traces, at the foot of rugged mountains,
on shores where there is nothing but the sea;
and suddenly I behold a temple, then a second, then
a third: I make my way through grass and weeds;
I mount on the socle of a column, or on the ruins
of a pediment: a cloud of ravens take their flight;
cows low in the bottom of a sanctuary; the adder,
basking between the column and the weeds, hisses
and makes his escape; a young shepherd, however,
carelessly leaning on an ancient cornice, stands serenading
with his reedy pipe the vast silence of this
desert.&#8221; Such was the language of Dupaty, when
he entered these celebrated ruins; nor was his enthusiasm
in any way misplaced.</p>

<p>Pæstum was a town of Lucania, called by the
Greeks Posidonia and Neptunia, from its being situated
in the bay. It was then called Sinus Pæstanus;
now the Gulf of Salerno.</p>

<p>Obscurity hangs not only over the origin, but
over the general history of this city. The mere outlines
have been sketched, perhaps, with accuracy;
but the details are, doubtless, obliterated for ever.</p>

<p>In scenery Pæstum yields not only to Baiæ, but to
many other towns in the vicinity of Vesuvius; yet,
in noble and well-preserved monuments of antiquity,
it surpasses any city in Italy; the immortal capital
alone excepted.</p>

<p>The origin of the city may be safely referred to
remote antiquity; but those are probably in the right,
who would fix the period at which the existing temples
were erected, as a little posterior to the building
of the Parthenon at Athens. But even this calculation
leaves them the venerable age of twenty-two centuries;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
and so firm and strong are they still, that,
except in the case of extraordinary convulsions of
nature, two thousand two hundred and many more
years may pass over their mighty columns and architraves,
and they remain, as they now are,&mdash;the
object of the world&#8217;s admiration.</p>

<p>Whatever age we may ascribe to the temples,
certain it is that the city cannot be less than two
thousand five hundred years old.</p>

<p>It was founded by a colony of the Dorians, who
called it Posetan; a Ph&#339;nician name for the God of
the Sea, to whom it was dedicated. Those settlers
were driven out by the Sybarites, who extended
the name to Posidonia. The Sybarites were expelled
by the Lucanians; and these, in turn, were expelled
by the Romans, who took possession of it (A.C. 480).
From this time the poets alone are found to speak of
it. It was, nevertheless, the first city of Southern
Italy, that embraced the Christian doctrine. In
840, the Saracens, having subdued Sicily, surprised
the city, and took possession. The question now
arises, to whom was Pæsium indebted for its temples?
To this it has been answered, that, as the
ruins seem to exhibit the oldest specimens of Greek
architecture now in existence, the probability is, that
they were erected by the Dorians.</p>

<p>&#8220;In beholding them,&#8221; says Mr. Eustace, &#8220;and
contemplating their solidity, bordering upon heaviness,
we are tempted to consider them as an intermediate
link between the Egyptian and Grecian monuments;
and the first attempt to pass from the immense
masses of the former, to the graceful proportions
of the latter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On entering the walls,&#8221; says Mr. Forsyth, &#8220;I
felt the religion of the place. I stood as on sacred
ground. I stood amazed at the long obscurity of its
mighty ruins. They can be descried with a glass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
from Salerno; the high road of Calabria commands a
distant view; the city of Capaccio looks down upon
them, and a few wretches have always lived on the
spot; yet they remain unnoticed by the best Neapolitan
antiquaries.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">first</span> temple<a name="FNanchor_103_112" id="FNanchor_103_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_112" class="fnanchor">103</a> that presents itself, to the traveller
from Naples, is the smallest. It consists of six pillars
at each end, and thirteen on each side. The
cella occupied more than one-third of the length, and
had a portico of two rows of columns, the shafts
and capitals of which, now overgrown with grass and
weeds, encumber the pavement, and almost fill the
area of the temple:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;The serpent sleeps, and the she-wolf</span>
<span class="i0">Suckles her young.</span>
</div></div>

<p>The columns of this temple are thick in proportion
to their elevation, and much closer to each other than
they are generally found to be in Greek temples; &#8220;and
this,&#8221; says Mr. Forsyth, &#8220;crowds them advantageously
on the eye, enlarges our idea of the space,
and gives a grand and heroic air to a monument of
very moderate dimensions.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the open space<a name="FNanchor_104_113" id="FNanchor_104_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_113" class="fnanchor">104</a> between the first and second
temples, were two other large buildings, built of the
same sort of stone, and nearly of the same size. Their
substructions still remain, encumbered with fragments
of the columns of the entablatures; and so overgrown
with brambles, nettles, and weeds, as scarcely to
admit a near inspection.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">second</span><a name="FNanchor_105_114" id="FNanchor_105_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_114" class="fnanchor">105</a>, or the Temple of <span class="smcap">Neptune</span>, is not
the largest, but by far the most massy and imposing
of the three: it has six columns in front and fourteen
in length; the angular column to the west, with its
capital, has been struck and partially shivered by
lightning. It once threatened to fall and ruin the
symmetry of one of the most perfect monuments now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>in existence, but it has been secured by iron cramps.
An inner peristyle of much smaller columns rises in
the cella, in two stories, with only an architrave,
which has neither frieze nor cornice between the
columns, which thus almost seem standing, the one
on the capital of the other&mdash;a defect in architecture,
which is, however, justified by Vitruvius and the
example of the Parthenon. The light pillars of this
interior peristyle, of which some have fallen, rise a
few feet above the exterior cornice and the massy
columns of the temple. Whether you gaze at this
wonderful edifice from without or from within, as
you stand on the floor of the cella, which is much
encumbered with heaps of fallen stones and rubbish,
the effect is awfully grand. The utter solitude, and
the silence, never broken save by the flight and
screams of the crows and birds of prey, which, your
approach may scare from the cornices and architraves,
where they roost in great numbers, add to the
solemn impression, produced by those firm-set and
eternal-looking columns.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">third</span> edifice is the largest<a name="FNanchor_106_115" id="FNanchor_106_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_115" class="fnanchor">106</a>. It has nine pillars
at the end and eighteen on the sides. Its size is not
its only distinction; a row of pillars, extending from
the middle pillar at one end to the middle pillar on
the other, divides it into equal parts, and it is considered
that though it is now called a temple, it
was not one originally. Some imagine it to have
been a Curia, others a Basilica, and others an
Exchange.</p>

<p>These relics stand on the edge of a vast and desolate
plain<a name="FNanchor_107_116" id="FNanchor_107_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_116" class="fnanchor">107</a>, that extends from the neighbourhood of
Salerno nearly to the confines of Calabria. The approach
to them is exceedingly impressive. For miles
scarcely a human habitation is seen, or any living
creature, save herds of buffaloes. And when you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>are within the lines of the ancient walls of the town&mdash;of
the once opulent and magnificent Pæstum&mdash;only
a miserable little taverna, or house of entertainment,
a barn, and a mean modern edifice, belonging
to the nominal bishop of the place, and nearly
always uninhabited, meet your eye. But there the
three ancient edifices rise before you in the most imposing
and sublime manner&mdash;they can hardly be
called ruins, they have still such a character of firmness
and entireness. Their columns seem to be
rooted in the earth, or to have grown from it!</p>

<p>&#8220;Accustomed as we were<a name="FNanchor_108_117" id="FNanchor_108_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_117" class="fnanchor">108</a> to the ancient and
modern magnificence of Rome,&#8221; says Stuart, &#8220;in
regard to the Parthenon, and, by what we had heard
and read, impressed with an advantageous opinion
of what we were to see, we found the image our
fancy had preconceived greatly inferior to the real
object.&#8221; Yet Wheler, who upon such a subject
cannot be considered as of equal authority with
Stuart, says of the monuments of antiquity yet remaining
at Athens,&mdash;&#8220;I dare prefer them before any
place in the world, <i>Rome only excepted</i>.&#8221; &#8220;If,&#8221;
continues Dr. Clarke, &#8220;there be upon earth any
buildings, which may be fairly brought into a comparison
with the Parthenon, they are the temples of
Pæstum in Lucania. But even these can only be so
with reference to their superior antiquity, to their
severe simplicity, and to the perfection of design
visible in their structure. In graceful proportion, in
magnificence, in costliness of materials, in splendid
decoration, and in every thing that may denote the
highest degree of improvement to which the Doric
style of architecture ever attained, they are vastly
inferior.&#8221; This is, at least, that author&#8217;s opinion.
Lusieri, however, entertained different sentiments.
Lusieri had resided at Pæstum; and had dedicated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>to those buildings a degree of study which, added to
his knowledge of the arts, well qualified him to
decide upon a question as to the relative merits of
the Athenian and Posidonian specimens of Grecian
architecture. His opinion is very remarkable. He
considered the temples at Pæstum as examples of a
pure style, or, as he termed it, of a more correct and
classical taste. &#8220;In these buildings,&#8221; said he, &#8220;the
Doric order attained a pre-eminence beyond which it
never passed; not a stone has been there placed
without some evident and important design; every
part of the structure bespeaks its own essential
utility<a name="FNanchor_109_118" id="FNanchor_109_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_118" class="fnanchor">109</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can there be any doubt,&#8221; says Mr. Williams,
&#8220;that in the temple of Neptune at Pæstum, the
very forms have something within themselves, calculated
to fill the mind with the impression which
belongs to the sublime; whilst, in the temple of
Theseus (at Athens), the simple preservation of its
form bespeaks that species of admiration, that peculiar
feeling, which beauty is calculated to draw forth?
It required not age to constitute the one sublime, or
the other beautiful. In truth, their respective characters
must have been much more deeply impressed
upon them in their most perfect state, than in the
mutilated form in which they now stand; surrounded
by the adventitious attributes with which antiquity
invests every monument of human art.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>
<p>Several medals<a name="FNanchor_110_119" id="FNanchor_110_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_119" class="fnanchor">110</a> have been found at Pæstum; but
they denote a degeneracy from Grecian skill and
elegance, being more clumsily designed and executed
than most coins of Magna Græcia.</p>

<p>The private habitations<a name="FNanchor_111_120" id="FNanchor_111_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_120" class="fnanchor">111</a> were unable to resist the
dilapidations of so many ages; but the town wall is
almost entire, and incloses an area of three miles in
circumference. In many places it is of the original
height, and built with oblong stones, dug out of the
adjacent fields. They are a red tavertino, formed
by a sediment of sulphureous water, of which a
strong stream washes the foot of the walls. It comes
from the mountains, and, spreading itself over a flat,
forms pools, where buffaloes are in summer continually
wallowing up to their noses.</p>

<p>These walls are built of huge polyhedric stones<a name="FNanchor_112_121" id="FNanchor_112_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_121" class="fnanchor">112</a>,
which afford some idea of what has been lately
thought the Cyclopean construction. Their materials,
however, are a grey stone, without any mixture
of the marble, granite, and lava, which are held
essential to their construction. They are five, at
least<a name="FNanchor_113_122" id="FNanchor_113_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_122" class="fnanchor">113</a>, and, in some places, twelve feet high. They
are formed of solid blocks of stone, with towers at
intervals; the archway of one gate only, however,
stands entire. Considering the materials and the
extent of this rampart, which incloses a space of
nearly four miles round, with the many towers that
rose at intervals, and its elevation of more than forty
feet, it must be acknowledged that it was, on the
whole, a work not only of great strength, but of
great magnificence.</p>

<p>The material, of which they are built, is the same
throughout each of the temples and common to all.
It is an exceedingly hard, but porous and brittle
stone, of a sober brownish-grey colour. It is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>curious fact, that not only the ignorant people on the
spot, but Neapolitan antiquaries also, wonder whence
the ancients brought these masses of curious stone:
and yet few things are more certain, than that they
found them on the spot.</p>

<p>The stone of these edifices<a name="FNanchor_114_123" id="FNanchor_114_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_123" class="fnanchor">114</a> was probably formed at
Pæstum itself, by the brackish water of the Salso
acting on vegetable earth, roots, and plants; for you
can distinguish their petrified tubes in every column:&mdash;and
Mr. Macfarlane, who passed a considerable
time on the spot, adds, &#8220;The brackish water of the
river Salso that runs by the wall of the town, and in
different branches across the plain, has so strong a
petrifying virtue that you can almost follow the
operation with the eye. The waters of the neighbouring
Sele (a considerable river&mdash;the ancient Silarus)
have in all ages been remarkable for the same quality.
In many places where the soil had been removed, we
perceived strata of stone similar to the stones which
compose the temples; and I could almost venture to
say that the substratum of all the plain, from the
Sele to Acropoli, is of the like substance. Curious
petrifactions of leaves, pieces of wood, insects, and
other vegetable and animal matters, are observed in
the materials of columns, walls, &amp;c.&#8221;</p>

<p>Taking these wonderful objects into view<a name="FNanchor_115_124" id="FNanchor_115_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_124" class="fnanchor">115</a>, their
immemorial antiquity, their astonishing preservation,
their grandeur, or rather grandiosity, their bold
columnar elevation, at once massive and open, their
severe simplicity of design, that simplicity in which
art gradually begins, and to which, after a thousand
revolutions of ornament, it again returns, taking, says
Mr. Forsyth, all into one view, &#8220;I do not hesitate to
call these the most impressive monuments I ever beheld
on earth.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>Within<a name="FNanchor_116_125" id="FNanchor_116_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_125" class="fnanchor">116</a> those walls, that once encircled a populous
and splendid city, now rise one cottage, two farm-houses,
a villa, and a church. The remaining space
is covered with thick, matted grass, overgrown with
brambles, spreading over the ruins, or buried under
yellow, undulating corn; a few rose-bushes flourish
neglected here and there, and still blossom twice a
year;&mdash;in May and December. They are remarkable
for their fragrance. Amid these objects and
scenes, rural and ordinary, rise the three temples,
like the mausoleums of the ruined city, dark, silent,
and majestic<a name="FNanchor_117_126" id="FNanchor_117_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_126" class="fnanchor">117</a>.</p>

<h2>NO. XIX.&mdash;POMPEII.</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-186a.jpg" width="500" height="313" alt="Pompeii" title="" />
<div class="caption">POMPEII</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> city is said to have been built by Hercules;
and so called, because the hero there exhibited a long
procession (Pompa) of the captives, he had taken in
Spain, and the head of Geryon, which he had
obtained by conquest.</p>

<p>The Oscans, Cumæans, Etruscans, and Samnites,
seem to have been successive possessors of the district
in which the city stood.</p>

<p>Although evidently of Grecian origin, nothing certain
is known of its early history. With many other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>cities, it underwent various reverses during the Punic
and Social wars of the Romans. It was besieged by
Sylla; and, about the age of Augustus, became a
colony; when its history merges in the more important
annals of the Roman Empire.</p>

<p>Pompeii shared the fate of Herculaneum<a name="FNanchor_118_127" id="FNanchor_118_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_127" class="fnanchor">118</a>.</p>

<p>In the month of February, A. D. 63, the Pompeians
were surprised by an earthquake and eruption, which
caused considerable damage. As soon, however, as the
inhabitants had recovered their consternation, they
began to clear away the ruins, and to repair the
damage sustained by the edifices.</p>

<p>After an interval of sixteen years, during which
period several shocks were experienced, on the night of
the 29th of August, A. D. 79, a volume of smoke
and ashes issued from the mouth of the crater of
Vesuvius with a tremendous explosion. After rising
to a certain height, it extended itself like a lofty pine;
and, assuming a variety of colours, fell and covered
the surrounding country with desolation and dismay.</p>

<p>The inhabitants, terrified by repeated shocks, and
breathing an atmosphere no longer fit to support life,
sought refuge in flight; but were suffocated by the
ashes, oppressed by flames of fire, or overwhelmed by
the falling edifices. In this awful time, Pliny the
Elder lost his life.</p>

<p>Pompeii, notwithstanding this, once more rose from
its ashes; but was again overwhelmed in A. D. 471<a name="FNanchor_119_128" id="FNanchor_119_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_128" class="fnanchor">119</a>.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to decide upon the relative
magnitude of Pompeii and Herculaneum: yet, from
the lead it takes in ancient authors, the former must,
in all probability, have been the most populous. Its
walls were once washed by the waves: but the sea
has since retired to some distance. The chief approach
from Rome to Pompeii was through Naples
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>and Herculaneum, along a branch of the Appian
way<a name="FNanchor_120_129" id="FNanchor_120_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_129" class="fnanchor">120</a>.</p>

<p>As you walk round the city walls<a name="FNanchor_121_130" id="FNanchor_121_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_130" class="fnanchor">121</a>, and see how the
volcanic matter is piled upon it in one heap, it looks as
though the hand of man had purposely buried it,
by carrying and throwing over it the volcanic matter.
This matter does not spread in any direction
beyond the town, over the fine plain which gently
declines towards the bay of Naples. The volcanic
eruption was so confined in its course or its fall, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>to bury Pompeii, and only Pompeii:&mdash;for the showers
of ashes and pumice-stone, which descended in the
immediate neighbourhood, certainly made but a slight
difference in the elevation of the plain. When a
town has been buried by lava, like Herculaneum, the
process is easily traced. You can follow the black,
hardened lava from the cone of the mountain to the
sea, whose waters it invaded for &#8220;many a rood;&#8221;
and those who have seen the lava in its liquid
state, when it flows on like a river of molten
iron, can conceive at once how it would bury
every thing it found in its way. There is often a
confusion of ideas, among those who have not had
the advantage of visiting these interesting places, as
to the matter which covers Pompeii and Herculaneum.
They fancy they were both buried by lava.
Herculaneum was so, and the work of excavating
there was like digging in a quarry of very hard
stone. The descent into the places, cleared, is like
the descent into a quarry or mine, and you are always
under ground, lighted by torches. But Pompeii<a name="FNanchor_122_131" id="FNanchor_122_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_131" class="fnanchor">122</a>
was covered by loose mud, pumice-stone, and ashes;
over which, in the course of centuries, there collected
vegetable soil. Beneath this shallow soil, the whole
is very crumbly and easy to dig,&mdash;in few spots more
difficult than one of our common gravel-pits. The
matter excavated is carried off in carts, and thrown
outside the town; and at times when the labour is carried
on with activity, as cart after cart withdraws with
the earth that covered them, you see houses entire,
except their roofs, which have nearly all fallen in,
make their appearance; and, by degrees, a whole
street opens to the sunshine or the shower, just like
the streets of any inhabited neighbouring town. It
is curious to observe, as the volcanic matter is removed,
that the houses are built principally of lava,
the more ancient product of the same Vesuvius,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>whose latter result buried and concealed Pompeii for
so many ages.</p>

<p>It is certainly surprising<a name="FNanchor_123_132" id="FNanchor_123_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_132" class="fnanchor">123</a>, that this most interesting
city should have remained undiscovered till so
late a period, and that antiquaries and learned men
should have so long and materially erred about its
situation. In many places, masses of ruins, portions
of the buried theatres, temples, and houses, were not
two feet below the surface of the soil. The country
people were continually digging up pieces of worked
marble, and other antique objects. In several spots
they had even laid open the outer walls of the town;
and yet men did not find out what it was that the
peculiar isolated mound of cinders and ashes, earth
and pumice-stone, covered. There is another circumstance
which increases the wonder of Pompeii being
so long concealed. A subterranean canal, cut from
the river Sarno, traverses the city, and is seen darkly
and silently gliding under the temple of Isis. This
is said to have been cut towards the middle of the
fifteenth century, to supply the contiguous town of
Torre dell&#8217; Annunziata with fresh water; it probably
ran anciently in the same channel; but cutting it, or
clearing it, workmen must have crossed under Pompeii
from one side to the other.</p>

<p>In a work, so limited in extent as this, it is utterly
impossible to give any thing like a representation of
the various objects to be seen in the exceedingly
curious ruins of this city. We can, therefore, only
give a general outline, and refer the reader to the
very beautiful illustrations, published by Sir William
Gell, in 1817 and 1819; and more especially to those
published by the same accomplished antiquary in
1832. Never was there any thing equal, or in any
way assimilating to them, in the world before! The
former work contains all that was excavated up to
those years; the latter the topography, edifices, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>ornaments of Pompeii, the result of excavation since
1819.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pompeii,&#8221; writes Mr. Taylor to M. Ch. Nodier,
&#8220;has passed near twenty centuries in the bowels of
the earth; nations have trodden above its site, while
its monuments still remained standing, and all their
ornaments untouched. A cotemporary of Augustus,
could he return hither, might say, &#8216;I greet thee,
O my country! my dwelling is the only spot upon
the earth which has preserved its form; an immunity
extending even to the smallest objects of my affection.
Here is my couch; there are my favourite
authors. My paintings, also, are still fresh, as when
the ingenious artist spread them over my walls.
Come, let us traverse the town; let us visit the theatre;
I recognise the spot where I joined, for the first time,
in the plaudits given to the fine scenes of Terence
and Euripides. Rome is but one vast museum;&mdash;Pompeii
is <i>a living antiquity</i>.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The houses of Pompeii are upon a small scale;
generally of one, sometimes of two stories. The
principal apartments are always behind, inclosing a
court, with a portico round it, and a marble cistern
in the middle. The pavements are all mosaic, and
the walls are stained with agreeable colours; the decorations
are basso-relievos in stucco, and paintings
in medallion. Marble seems to have been common.</p>

<p>On both sides of the street<a name="FNanchor_124_133" id="FNanchor_124_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_133" class="fnanchor">124</a> the houses stand quite
in contact with each other, as in modern times.
They are nearly of the same height and dimensions,
being similarly paved and painted. The houses, as
we have before stated, are on a small scale. The
principal apartments are always behind, surrounding
a court, with a small piazza about it, and having a
cistern of marble in its centre.</p>

<p>An edifice, supposed to be Sallust&#8217;s house, has an
unusually showy appearance. The rooms are painted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>with the figures of gods and goddesses, and the floors
decorated with marbles and mosaic pavements.</p>

<p>The gates of the city, now visible, are five in
number. These are known by the names of Herculaneum
or Naples, Vesuvius, Nola, Sarno, and
Stabiæ<a name="FNanchor_125_134" id="FNanchor_125_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_134" class="fnanchor">125</a>. The city was surrounded with walls, the
greater portion of which have also been traced. Its
greatest length is little more than half a mile, and its
circuit nearly two miles. It occupied an area of
about one hundred and sixty-one acres. The general
figure of the city is something like that of an egg.
There have been excavated about eighty houses, an
immense number of small shops, the public baths,
two theatres, two basilicæ, eight temples, the prison,
the amphitheatre, with other public buildings of less
note; and also fountains and tombs. The streets
are paved with large irregular pieces of lava, neatly
dovetailed into each other. This pavement is rutted
with the chariot wheels, sometimes to the depth of
one inch and a half. In general, the streets are so
narrow, that they may be crossed at one stride;
where they are of greater breadth, a stepping-stone
was placed in the middle for the convenience of foot
passengers. On each side of the street there is a
footpath, the sides of which are provided with curbs,
varying from one foot to eighteen inches high, to
prevent the encroachments of the chariots.</p>

<p>It is well known<a name="FNanchor_126_135" id="FNanchor_126_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_135" class="fnanchor">126</a>, that amongst the Romans
bathing formed part of every day&#8217;s occupation. In
the year 1824, the baths of Pompeii were excavated.
They are admirably arranged, spacious, highly decorated,
and superior to any thing of the kind in modern
cities. They are, fortunately, in good preservation,
and throw considerable light on what the ancients
have written upon the subject. Various circumstances
prove, that the completion of the baths only
a short while preceded the destruction of the city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>They occupy a considerable space, and are divided
into three separate apartments. One of these was set
apart for the fire-places and the accommodation of
the servants, and the other two were each occupied
by a set of baths, one of which was appropriated to
the men, and the other to the women. The apartments
and passages are paved with white marble in
mosaic, or alternate white and black squares. The
chambers are ornamented with various devices, and
highly finished. Above one thousand lamps were
discovered during the excavation.</p>

<p>There have been two theatres excavated, a large
and a small one; both of which display the remains
of considerable magnificence. They are constructed
after the usual plan of a Roman theatre. The
theatre is formed upon the side of a hill, the corridor
being the highest part, so that the audience, on
entering, descended at once to their seats. There is
space to contain about five thousand persons. This
theatre appears to have been entirely covered with
marble, although only a few fragments remain.</p>

<p>The smaller theatre nearly resembles the larger one
in plan and disposition of parts; but there is this
remarkable difference;&mdash;it appears from an inscription
to have been permanently roofed. It has been
computed that it accommodated one thousand five
hundred persons.</p>

<p>The amphitheatre of Pompeii does not differ in any
particular from other Roman buildings of the same
kind. Its form is oval; its length is four hundred
and thirty feet; and its greatest breadth three hundred
and thirty-five feet. There were paintings in
fresco&mdash;one, representing a tigress fighting with a
wild boar; another, a stag chased by a lioness;
another, a battle between a bull and a bear. There
were other representations besides these; but the
whole disappeared upon exposure to the atmosphere<a name="FNanchor_127_136" id="FNanchor_127_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_136" class="fnanchor">127</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>
<p>Adjoining to the theatre<a name="FNanchor_128_137" id="FNanchor_128_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_137" class="fnanchor">128</a>, a building has been
excavated, called, from the style of its architecture,
the Greek temple; otherwise, the temple of Hercules.
The date of its erection some have supposed to be
as far back as eight hundred years before the
Christian era. It is in a very dilapidated state.
Before the steps in front there is an inclosure, supposed
to have been a pen to contain victims for the
sacrifice; and by its side there are two altars.</p>

<p>The temple of Isis<a name="FNanchor_129_138" id="FNanchor_129_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_138" class="fnanchor">129</a> is one of the most perfect
examples, now existing, of the parts and disposition
of an ancient temple. The skeleton of a priest was
found in one of the rooms. Near his remains lay an
axe, from which it would appear, that he had delayed
his departure till the door was closed up, and
so attempted to break through the walls with his
axe. He had already forced his way through two;
but before he could pass the third, was suffocated by
the vapour. Within the sacred precincts, doubtless,
lay a number of skeletons; probably those of the
priests, who, reposing a vain confidence in their deity,
would not desert her temple, until escape was hopeless.
Several paintings of the priests of Isis, and the ceremonies
of their worship, were found, together with a
statue of the deity herself.</p>

<p>One of the buildings, surrounding the forum, has
received the appellation of the Pantheon, from there
having been found in the centre of its area an altar
encircled with twelve pedestals; on which, it has
been supposed, stood the statues of the mythological
deities. The area is one hundred and twenty feet
in length, by ninety in breadth. Numerous cells,
attached to this building, have been found; these, in
all probability, were for the accommodation of priests.
Near to this place were discovered statues of Nero
and Messalina, and ninety-three brass coins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>Adjoining to the Pantheon<a name="FNanchor_130_139" id="FNanchor_130_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_139" class="fnanchor">130</a> is a building, supposed
to have been a place for the meeting of the senate or
town-council. In the centre is an altar, and on each
side of this, in two large recesses, stand two pedestals,
which most likely supported effigies of the gods to
whom the place was sacred. Near this is a small
temple, elevated on a basement. On the altar there
is an unfinished bas-relief, representing a sacrifice.
In the cells attached to the building were found a
number of vessels in which wine was kept.</p>

<p>Adjoining to this is a large building, which, from
various inscriptions, appears to have been erected at
the expense of a lady named Eumachia, for the benefit
of the public. Amongst other relics found, was
a statue of this lady, five feet four inches high.</p>

<p>The forum of Pompeii<a name="FNanchor_131_140" id="FNanchor_131_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_140" class="fnanchor">131</a> is situated at the northeast
corner of the city, and is entered by a flight of
steps, leading downwards through an arch in a brick
wall, still partly covered with stucco. Upon entering,
the spectator finds himself in a large area, surrounded
by columns, the ruins of temples, triumphal
arches, and other public erections. There are, also,
a number of pedestals for the support of statues.</p>

<p>There is a subterranean wine-vault<a name="FNanchor_132_141" id="FNanchor_132_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_141" class="fnanchor">132</a> near the city
gates, which has been examined with great attention.
It is very extensive, and contains the earthen vessels
and bottles wherein the wine had been kept.
They were arranged in the same precise order as
previous to the awful eruption which desolated the
city. The interior of this place much resembles
cloisters, the roof being arched with strong stones.
It was in these vaults where the unhappy inhabitants
sought refuge from the sudden and overwhelming
shower of fire and ashes.</p>

<p>After such an amazing lapse of time<a name="FNanchor_133_142" id="FNanchor_133_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_142" class="fnanchor">133</a>, liquids have
been found approaching to a fluid state&mdash;an instance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>of which cannot be sufficiently admired, in a phial
of oil, conceived to be that of olives. It is white,
greasy to the touch, and emits the smell of rancid
oil. An earthen vase was found, in the cellars, containing
wine, which now resembles a lump of porous
dark violet-coloured glass. Eggs, also, have been
found, whole and empty.</p>

<p>On the north side<a name="FNanchor_134_143" id="FNanchor_134_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_143" class="fnanchor">134</a> of the Pantheon, there runs a
street, named the Street of Dried Fruits, from the
quantity of fruits of various kinds, preserved in
glass vases, which have been found. Scales, money,
moulds for pastry and bread, were discovered in the
shops, and a bronze statue of Fame, small and well
executed; having bright bracelets of gold upon the
arms. In the entrance which conducts from this
street to the Pantheon a box was found, containing
a gold ring with an engraved stone in it; also, forty-one
silver, and one thousand and thirty-six brass, coins.</p>

<p>On the walls are representations of Cupid making
bread. The mill stands in the centre of the picture,
with an ass on each side; from which it has been inferred,
that these animals were employed in grinding
corn. Besides these, there are in this building a
great number of very beautiful paintings.</p>

<p>Three bakers&#8217; shops<a name="FNanchor_135_144" id="FNanchor_135_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_144" class="fnanchor">135</a> at least have been found, all
in a tolerable state of preservation. The mills, the
oven, the kneading-troughs, the vessels for containing
water, flour, and leaven, have all been discovered,
and seem to leave nothing wanting to our knowledge.
In some vessels the very flour remained, still capable
of being identified, though reduced almost to a cinder.
One of these shops was attached to the house of
Sallust; the other to that of Pansa. The third
seems to have belonged to a sort of capitalist: for
instead of renting a mere dependency in another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>man&#8217;s house, he lived in a tolerably good house of
his own, of which the bakery forms a part.</p>

<p>Beneath the oven is an ash-pit. To the right is
a large room, which is conjectured to be a stable.
The jaw of an ass, and some other fragments of a
skeleton, were found in it. There is a reservoir for
water at the farther end, which passes through the
wall, and is common both to this room and the next,
so that it could be filled without going into the
stable.</p>

<p>In another place<a name="FNanchor_136_145" id="FNanchor_136_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_145" class="fnanchor">136</a> there is an oil-mill; in a third,
supposed to have been a prison, stocks were found;
and in a fourth were pieces of armour, whence it
has been called the Guard-room. In this quarter of
the city a bronze helmet was found, enriched with
bas-reliefs, relating to the principal events of the capture
of Troy. Another helmet found represents the
Triumph of Rome; greaves of bronze, highly ornamented,
also were found.</p>

<p>Contiguous to the little theatre, the house of a
sculptor has been cleared. There were found statues;
some half finished; others just begun: with
blocks of marble, and all the tools required by the
sculptor.</p>

<p>The walls, in the interior of the buildings, are
generally adorned with fresco paintings, the colours
of which are in a state of perfect preservation, and
have all the freshness of recent finishing. The shells,
also, which decorate some of the public fountains,
have sustained no injury from the lapse of ages, or
the volcanic products in which they were buried.</p>

<p>During the progress of excavation,<a name="FNanchor_137_146" id="FNanchor_137_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_146" class="fnanchor">137</a> at Pompeii,
a painting was found in the Casa Carolina, which
scarcely held together to be copied, and fell to pieces
upon the first rain. It was of grotesque character, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>represented a pigmy painter, whose only covering was
a tunic. He is at work upon the portrait of another
pigmy, clothed in a manner to indicate a person
of distinction. The artist is sitting opposite to
his sitter, at an awful distance from the picture,
which is placed under an easel, similar in construction
to ours. By the side of the artist stands his
palette, which is a little table with four feet, and by
it is a pot to wash his pencils in. He therefore was
working with gum, or some sort of water-colours:
but he did not confine himself to this branch of the
arts; for to the right we see his colour-grinder, who
prepares, in a vessel placed over some hot coals, colours
mixed with wax and oil. Two amateurs enter the
studio, and appear to be conversing with respect to
the picture. On the noise occasioned by their entrance,
a scholar, seated in the distance, turns round
to look at them. It is difficult to explain the presence
of the bird in the painting-room. The picture
is not complete: a second bird, and, at the opposite
side, a child playing with a dog, had perished before
Mazois (an artist who has preserved some of the
most valuable remains at Pompeii) copied it. This
picture is very curious, since it shows how few things,
in the mechanical practice of painting, have changed
during two thousand years.</p>

<p>There is another picture<a name="FNanchor_138_147" id="FNanchor_138_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_147" class="fnanchor">138</a> preserved at Pompeii,
representing a female, employed in making a copy
of a bearded Bacchus. She is dressed in a light
green tunic, without sleeves, over which she wears
a dark red mantle. Beside her is a box, such, as
we are told by Varro, as painters used, divided into
compartments, into which she dips her brush.</p>

<p>Among the recent discoveries at Pompeii<a name="FNanchor_139_148" id="FNanchor_139_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_148" class="fnanchor">139</a>, may
also be enumerated a bronze vase, encrusted with silver,
the size and form of which have been much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>admired, and a bronze statue of Apollo, of admirable
workmanship. The deity is represented as sacrificing,
with his avenging arm, the family of Niobe; and the
beauty of its form, and the life of the figure, are so fine,
that it is said to be the finest statue in the Bourbon
Museum. &#8220;As to the furniture,&#8221; says Mr. Mathews,
&#8220;they illustrate Solomon&#8217;s apophthegm, that there is
nothing new under the sun; for there is much, that,
with a little scouring, would scarcely appear old-fashioned
at the present day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a source of great amusement,&#8221; says Mr.
Blunt, &#8220;to observe the doors of café-keepers, barbers,
tailors, tradesmen, in short, of every description,
surmounted by very tolerable pictures, indicating
their respective occupations. Thus, at a surgeon and
apothecary&#8217;s, for instance, I have seen a series of
paintings displaying a variety of cases, to which the
doctor is applying his healing hand. In one he is
extracting a tooth; in another applying an emetic; in
a third bandaging an arm or a leg.&#8221; In 1819, several
surgical instruments were discovered in the ruins of
a house near the gate adjoining to the burial-ground<a name="FNanchor_140_149" id="FNanchor_140_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_149" class="fnanchor">140</a>.</p>

<p>In a street, which conducts to the Forum, called
the Street of Fortune, an immense number of
utensils have been found. Amongst other articles,
were vases, basins with handles, bells, elastic springs,
hinges, buckles for harness, a lock, an inkstand, gold
ear-rings, a silver spoon, an oval caldron, a saucepan,
a mould for pastry, and a weight of alabaster
used in spinning, with its ivory axis remaining; a
number of lamps, three boxes, in one of which were
found several coins of Titus, Vespasian, Domitian, &amp;c.
Among the most curious things found, were seven
glazed plates, packed in straw; a pair of scales and
steelyard were also discovered.</p>

<p>Fishing-nets<a name="FNanchor_141_150" id="FNanchor_141_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_150" class="fnanchor">141</a>, some of them quite entire, have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>found in great numbers in Herculaneum as well as in
Pompeii. Linen, also, with the texture well defined.
In the shop of a baker a loaf was found, still retaining
its form, with the baker&#8217;s name stamped upon it,
and which, to satisfy the curiosity of modern professors
of the art, we shall give: it was &#8220;Eleris J.
Crani Riser.&#8221; On the counter of an apothecary&#8217;s
shop was a box of pills; and by the side of it, a
small cylindrical roll, evidently ready for cutting up.</p>

<p>Along the south-side of another building runs a
broad street, which, from various articles of jewellery
being found there, is called the Street of the Silversmiths.
On the walls of the shops several inscriptions appear,
one of which has been thus translated: &#8220;The Scribe
Issus beseeches Marcus Cerrinius Vatia, the &AElig;dile, to
patronise him; he is deserving.&#8221;</p>

<p>Near to the small theatre, a large angular inclosure
has been excavated, which has been called the
Provision Market by some, by others the Soldiers&#8217;
Quarters. It contains a number of small chambers,
supposed to have been occupied by butchers, and
vendors of meats, liquors, &amp;c. In one of these was
discovered utensils for the manufacture of soap.</p>

<p>If we again fancy for a moment the furniture<a name="FNanchor_142_151" id="FNanchor_142_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_151" class="fnanchor">142</a>, implements,
and utensils, which would be brought to
light in our own houses and shops, supposing them to
be overwhelmed, and thus laid open some centuries
hence, we might conjecture that many of the same
description must have belonged to those of a nation
so civilised as the Romans; but still it is pleasing to
ascertain, from a testimony that cannot deceive us,
the evidence of the relics themselves, that they had
scales very little different from our own; silver
spoons, knives (but no forks), gridirons, spits, frying-pans,
scissars, needles, instruments of surgery, syringes,
saws, and many more, all made of fine brass;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>that they had hammers, and picks, and compasses,
and iron crows, all of which were met with in a
statuary&#8217;s shop; and that they had stamps which they
used, as well for other purposes, as for impressing the
name of its owner on bread before it was sent to the
oven. Thus on a loaf, still preserved, is legible:
<i>Siligo C. Glanii</i>:&mdash;This is Caius Glanius&#8217; loaf.</p>

<p>Many of their seals were preserved in this manner;
consisting of an oblong piece of metal, stamped with
letters of the motto; instruments very similar to those
used in England for marking linen. Thus possessed
of types and of ink, how little were the Romans removed
from the discovery of the art and advantages
of printing!</p>

<p>At the end of one of the streets<a name="FNanchor_143_152" id="FNanchor_143_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_152" class="fnanchor">143</a>, was discovered a
skeleton of a Pompeian, who, apparently for the sake
of sixty coins, a small plate, and a saucepan of silver,
had remained in the house till the street was already
half filled with volcanic matter. From the situation
in which he was found, he had apparently been
arrested in the act of escaping from the window.
Two others were also found in the same street.</p>

<p>Only sixty skeletons<a name="FNanchor_144_153" id="FNanchor_144_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_153" class="fnanchor">144</a> have been discovered in all;
it is, therefore, clear, that the greater part of the
inhabitants had found time to escape. There were
found in the vault of a house in the suburbs, the
skeletons of seventeen individuals, who appear to
have sought refuge there from the showers of ashes
which poured from the sky. There was also preserved,
in the same place<a name="FNanchor_145_154" id="FNanchor_145_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_154" class="fnanchor">145</a>, a sketch of a woman,
supposed to have been the mistress of the house, with
an infant locked in her arms. Her form was imprinted
upon the work, which formed her sepulchre; but only
the bones remained. To these a chain of gold was suspended;
and rings, with jewels, were upon her fingers.
The remains of a soldier, also, were found in a niche,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>where, in all probability, he was performing the
office of sentinel. His hand still grasped a lance,
and the usual military accoutrements were also found
there.</p>

<p>In one of the baths<a name="FNanchor_146_155" id="FNanchor_146_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_155" class="fnanchor">146</a>, as we have before stated,
was found the skeleton of a female, whose arms and
neck were covered with jewels. In addition to gold
bracelets, was a necklace; the workmanship of which
is marvellous. Our most skilful jewellers could make
nothing more elegant, or of a better taste. It has
all the beautiful finish of the Moorish jewels of
Granada, and of the same designs which are to be
found in the dresses of the Moorish women, and of
the Jewesses of Tetuan, on the coast of Africa.</p>

<p>It is generally supposed, that the destruction of
this city was sudden and unexpected; and it is even
recorded, that the people were surprised and overwhelmed
at once by the volcanic storm, while in the
theatre. (Dionys. of Hal.) But to this opinion
many objections may be raised, amongst which this;
that the number of skeletons in Pompeii does not
amount to sixty; and ten times this number would
be inconsiderable, when compared with the extent
and population of the city.</p>

<p>The most perfect and most curious object, however,
that has yet been discovered, is a villa at a little
distance from the town. It consists of three courts;
in the third and largest is a pond, and in the centre
a small temple. There are numerous apartments of
every description, paved in mosaic, coloured and
adorned with various paintings on the walls; all in
a very beautiful style. This villa is supposed to have
belonged to Cicero.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ruins of Pompeii,&#8221; says Mr. Eustace, &#8220;possess
a secret power, that captivates and melts the
soul! In other times, and in other places, one single
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>edifice, a temple, a theatre, a tomb, that had escaped
the wreck of ages, would have enchanted us; nay, an
arch, the remnant of a wall, even one solitary column,
was beheld with veneration; but to discover
a single ancient house, the abode of a Roman in his
privacy, the scene of his domestic hours, was an
object of fond, but hopeless longing. Here, not a
temple, nor a theatre, nor a house, but a whole city
rises before us, untouched, unaltered&mdash;the very same
as it was eighteen hundred years ago, when inhabited
by Romans.  We range through the same
streets; tread the very same pavement; behold the
same walls; enter the same doors; and repose in the
same apartments. We are surrounded by the same
objects; and out of the same windows we contemplate
the same scenery. In the midst of all this, not a voice
is heard&mdash;not even the sound of a foot&mdash;to disturb
the loneliness of the place, or to interrupt his reflections.
All around is silence; not the silence of solitude
and repose, but of death and devastation:&mdash;the
silence of a great city without one single inhabitant:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8216;Horror ubique animos, simul ipsa silentia terrent.&#8217;</span>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps the whole world does not exhibit so awful
a spectacle as Pompeii; and when it was first discovered,
when skeletons were found heaped together in
the streets and houses, when all the utensils, and even
the very bread, of the poor suffocated inhabitants,
were discernible, what a speculation must this ill-fated
city have furnished to a thinking mind! To
visit it even now, is absolutely to live with the ancient
Romans; and when we see houses, shops, furniture,
fountains, streets, carriages, and implements of husbandry,
exactly similar to those of the present day,
we are apt to conclude, that customs and manners
have undergone but little alteration for the last two
thousand years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In walking through this city of the dead,&#8221; says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
Chateaubriand, &#8220;one idea has pursued me. As the
labourers clear the different edifices, they remove
whatever they discover,&mdash;household utensils, implements
of divers trades, pieces of furniture, statues,
MSS., &amp;c., all of which are promiscuously carried to
the Portici Museum. In my opinion, people might have
employed their time better. Why not have left these
things as they found them, and where they found
them? Instead of their removal, they should have
preserved them on the spot;&mdash;roofs, ceilings, floors,
and windows, should have been carefully restored, in
order to prevent the destruction of the walls and
paintings. The ancient inclosure of the town should
be rebuilt, the gates repaired, and a guard of soldiers
stationed there, together with some individuals well
versed in the arts. Would not this have been the
most interesting museum in the world? A Roman
town preserved quite entire, as if its inhabitants had
issued forth but a quarter of an hour before!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am filled with astonishment,&#8221; says Dupaty,
&#8220;in walking from house to house, from temple to
temple, from street to street, in a city built two
thousand years ago, inhabited by the Romans, dug
out by a king of Naples, and in perfect preservation.
I speak of Pompeii.</p>

<p>&#8220;The inhabitants of this city were asleep, when
suddenly an impetuous wind arose, and, detaching a
portion of the cinders which covered the summit of
Vesuvius, hurried them in whirlwinds through the
air over Pompeii, and within a quarter of an hour
entirely overwhelmed it, together with Herculaneum,
Sorento, a multitude of towns and villages, thousands
of men and women, and the elder Pliny. What a
dreadful awakening for the inhabitants? Imprudent
men! Why did you build Pompeii at the foot of
Vesuvius, on its lava, and on its ashes? In fact,
mankind resemble ants, which, after an accident has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
destroyed one of their hillocks, set about repairing it
the next moment. Pompeii was covered with ashes.
The descendants of those very men, who perished
under those ashes, planted vineyards, mulberry, fig,
and poplar trees on them; the roofs of this city were
become fields and orchards. One day, while some
peasants were digging, the spade penetrated a little
deeper than usual; something was found to resist.
It was a city. It was Pompeii. I entered several of
the rooms, and found in one of them a mill, with
which the soldiers ground their corn for bread; in
another an oil-mill, in which they crushed the olives.
The first resembles our coffee-mills; the second is
formed of two mill-stones, which were moved by the
hand, in a vast mortar, round an iron centre. In
another of these rooms I saw chains still fastened to
the leg of a criminal; in a second, heaps of human
bones; and in a third, a golden necklace.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is become of all the inhabitants? We see
nobody in the shops! not a creature in the streets!
all the houses are open! Let us begin by visiting the
houses on the right. This is not a private house;
that prodigious number of chirurgical instruments
prove this edifice must have had some relation to the
art in which they are used. This was surely a school
for surgery. These houses are very small; they are
exceedingly ill contrived; all the apartments are
detached; but then what neatness! what elegance!
In each of them is an inner portico, a mosaic pavement,
a square colonnade, and in the middle a cistern,
to collect the water falling from the roof. In
each of them are hot-baths, and stoves, and everywhere
paintings in fresco, in the best taste, and on
the most pleasing grounds. Has Raffaele been here
to copy his arabesques?</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us pass over to the other side of the street.
These houses are three stories high; their foundation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
is on the lava, which has formed here a sort of hill,
on the declivity of which they are built. From above,
in the third story, the windows look into the street;
and from the first story, into a garden.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what do I perceive in that chamber. They
are ten death&#8217;s-heads. The unfortunate wretches
saved themselves here, where they could not be saved.
This is the head of a little child: its father and
mother then are there! Let us go up stairs again;
the heart feels not at ease here. Suppose we take a
step into this temple for a moment, since it is left
open. What deity do I perceive in the bottom of
that niche? It is the god of Silence, who makes a
sign with his finger, to command silence, and points
to the goddess Isis, in the further recess of the
<i>sacrarium</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the front of the porch there are three altars.
Here the victims were slaughtered, and the blood,
flowing along this gutter into the middle of that
basin, fell from thence upon the head of the priests.
This little chamber, near the altar, was undoubtedly
the sacristy. The priests purified themselves in this
bathing-place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here are some inscriptions: &#8216;Popidi ambleati,
Cornelia celsa.&#8217; This is a monument erected to the
memory of those who have been benefactors to Isis;
that is to say, to her priests.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot be far from the country-house of Aufidius;
for there are the gates of the city. Here is the
tomb of the family of Diomedes. Let us rest a moment
under these porticoes, where the philosophers
used to sit.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not mistaken. The country-house of
Aufidius is charming; the paintings in fresco are
delicious. What an excellent effect have those blue
grounds! With what propriety, and consequently
with what taste, are the figures distributed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
panels! Flora herself has woven that garland. But
who has painted this Venus? this Adonis? this
youthful Narcissus, in that bath? And here again,
this charming Mercury? It is surely not a week
since they were painted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like this portico round the garden; and this
square covered cellar round the portico. Do these
amphoræ contain the true Falernian? How many
consulates has this wine been kept?</p>

<p>&#8220;But it is late. It was about this time the
play began. Let us go to the covered theatre: it is
shut. Let us go to the uncovered theatre; that too
is shut.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know not how far I have succeeded in this
attempt to give you an idea of Pompeii.&#8221; Excellently<a name="FNanchor_147_156" id="FNanchor_147_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_156" class="fnanchor">147</a>.</p>

<h2>NO. XX.&mdash;RAMA.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Rama</span> is supposed to have been built with materials,
furnished by the ruins of Lydda, three miles
distant; and it is the spot in which our titular saint,
St. George, is said to have suffered martyrdom;
although, according to most authors, his remains
repose in a magnificent temple at Lydda.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the present desolate condition of
Rama, it was, when the army of the Crusaders
arrived, a magnificent city, filled with wealth, and
abundance of all the luxuries of the East. It was
exceedingly populous, adorned with stately buildings,
and well fortified with walls and towers.</p>

<p>The Musselmans here reverence the tomb of
Locman, the wise; also the sepulchres of seventy
prophets, who are believed to have been buried here.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>
<p>Rama is situated about thirty miles from Jerusalem,
in the middle of an extensive and fertile plain,
which is part of the great field of Sharon. &#8220;It
makes,&#8221; says Dr. Clarke, &#8220;a considerable figure at
a distance; but we found nothing within the place
except traces of devastation and death. It exhibited
one scene of ruin: houses, fallen or deserted, appeared
on every side; and instead of inhabitants, we beheld
only the skeletons or putrifying carcasses of horses
and camels. A plague, or rather murrain, during
the preceding year, had committed such ravages,
that not only men, women, and children, but cattle
of all kinds, and every thing that had life, became its
victims. Few of the inhabitants of Europe can have
been aware of the state of suffering, to which all the
coast of Palestine and Syria was exposed. It
followed, and in part accompanied, the dreadful
ravages, caused by the march of the French army.
From the accounts we received, it seemed as if the
exterminating hand of Providence was exercised in
sweeping from the earth every trace of ancient
existence. &#8216;In Rama<a name="FNanchor_148_157" id="FNanchor_148_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_157" class="fnanchor">148</a> there was a voice heard;
lamentation and weeping, and great mourning;
Rachel weeping for her children, and could not be
comforted, because they were not.&#8217;&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_149_158" id="FNanchor_149_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_158" class="fnanchor">149</a></p>

<p>As the plan of this work does not admit of our
giving any thing like a history of the various trials
and fortunes of Rome; we must confine ourselves,
almost entirely, to a few particulars relative to its
origin, summit of glory and empire, its decay, and
ultimate ruin.</p>

<p>There is no unquestionable narrative of facts, on
which any writer can build the primitive history of this
vast city and empire; but in its place we have a mass
of popular traditions and fabulous records. On the
taking of Troy, &AElig;neas, a prince of that city, quitted
his native land, and after a long period, spent in
encountering a variety of vicissitudes, he arrived on
the coast of Italy, was received with hospitality by
the King of Latium, whose name was Latinus, and
afterwards obtained his throne, from the circumstance
of having married his daughter.</p>

<p>&AElig;neas after this built the city of Lavinium, and,
thirty years after, his son founded that of Alba Longa,
which then became the capital of Latium. Three
hundred years after, Romulus founded Rome.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-211a.jpg" width="500" height="308" alt="Rome." title="" />
<div class="caption">ROME.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>Though Livy has given a very circumstantial account
of the origin of this city, sufficient data have
been afforded, since his history was written, to justify
our doubting many of his statements. The first author
in modern times, that led Europe to these doubts,
was, we believe, Dr. Taylor; who, in a work written
about sixty years ago, entitled Elements of Civil
Law, has the following passage:&mdash;&#8220;It was not peculiar
to this people, to have the dawn of their history
wrapped up in fable and mythology, or set in with
something that looked like marvellous and preternatural.
There is scarce a nation, that we are acquainted
with, but has this foible in a greater or lesser
degree, and almost pleads a right to be indulged
in it. &#8220;Datur hæc venia antiquitati, ut miscendo
humana divinis primordia urbium augustiora faciat.&#8221;
(Liv. I. Præf.) Indeed the Romans themselves had
some suspicion of their own history. They generally
dated their periods not <span class="smcap lowercase">AB U. C.</span> but began their æra
from their consuls, by whom they always reckoned.
The records of Rome were burned at the irruption of
the Gauls: they had nothing for it but tradition before
that period. Nor was there an author extant of
that age, or near it, at the time that Livy compiled
his history. Diocles Peparethius (the father of
Roman history, since Fabius Pictor, the first historian
that Rome produced, and all his followers,
copied him implicitly) was a writer of no very great
credit. The birth and education of Romulus, is the
exact counter-part of that of another founder of a
great empire; and Romulus, I am satisfied, could
not resemble more his brother Remus, than his brother
Cyrus. The expedient of Tarquin&#8217;s conveying advice
to his son, by striking off the heads of flowers,
is given with the minutest difference, by Aristotle to
Periander of Corinth, and by Herodotus to Thrasybulus.
Which similarity is very ill accounted for by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
Camerarius. This was one of those ambulatory
stories which (Plutarch in his Greek and Roman
Parallels will furnish us with many such) seem
confined to no one age, race, or country; but have
been adopted in their turn, at several periods of time,
and by several very different people, and are perhaps,
at least some of them, true of none. And, lastly, one
would imagine, that the history of the seven kings,
which has such an air of romance in it, was made on
purpose for Florus to be ingenious upon in his recapitulation
of the regal state of Rome.&#8221;</p>

<p>The truth of this subject we leave to abler hands;
proceeding at once to the manner in which the ceremonies
are recorded to have been adopted at the first
laying down the foundations of the city. Romulus,
having sent for some of the Tuscans, to instruct him
in the ceremonies that ought to be observed in laying
the foundations, and they having instructed him
according to his desire, his work began in the following
manner:&mdash;First, he dug a trench, and threw
into it the first-fruits of all things, either good by
custom, or necessary by nature; and every man taking
a small turf of earth of the country from which he
came, they all cast them in promiscuously together.
Making their trench their centre, they described the
city in a circle round it. Then the founder fitted to a
plough a brazen plough-share; and yoking together
a bull and a cow, drew a deep line or furrow round
the bounds; those that followed after, taking care
that the clods fell inwards towards the city. They
built the wall upon this line, which they called Pom&#339;rium,
from pone m&#339;nia. Though the phrase of
Pom&#339;rium proferre be commonly used in authors,
to signify the enlarging of the city, it is, nevertheless,
certain that the city might be enlarged without that
ceremony. For Tacitus and Gellius declare no person
to have had a right of extending the Pom&#339;rium,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
but such a one as had taken away some part of an
enemy&#8217;s country in war; whereby, it is manifest, that
several great men, who never obtained the honour,
increased the buildings with considerable additions.
It is remarkable that the same ceremony with which
the foundations of their cities were first laid, they used,
too, in destroying and rasing places taken from the
enemy; which we find was begun by the chief commander&#8217;s
turning up some of the walls with a plough.</p>

<p>We do not, as we have before stated, propose to
give even a slight history of this celebrated city.
It is sufficient for our purpose to state, that it was
first governed by kings, and then by consuls, up to
the time when the Gauls took the city, under their
commander Brennus. This was the first calamity
that Rome experienced at the hands of an enemy;
and this occurred in the three hundred and sixty-fifth
year after its foundation.</p>

<p>The city of Veii had just surrendered to Camillus
after a ten years&#8217; siege, when the Gauls made an
irruption into Italy, and had begun to besiege Clusium,
a Tuscan city; at which time a deputation
arrived at Rome with an entreaty from the Clusians,
that the Romans would interfere in their behalf,
through the medium of ambassadors. This request
was immediately complied with; and three of the
Fabii, persons of the highest rank, were despatched
to the Gallic camp. The Gauls, out of respect to
the name of Rome, received these ambassadors with
all imaginable civility; but they could not be induced
to raise the siege. Upon this, the ambassadors going
into the town, and encouraging the Clusians to a
sally, one of them was seen personally engaged in
the action. This, being contrary to the generally
received law of nations, was resented in so high a
manner by the enemy, that, breaking up from before
Clusium, their whole army marched directly against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
Rome. At about eleven miles from the city, they
met with the Roman army, commanded by the
military tribunes; who, engaging without any order
or discipline, received an entire defeat. Upon the
arrival of this ill news at Rome, the greatest part of
the inhabitants immediately fled. Those that resolved
to stay, however, fortified themselves in the
Capitol. The Gauls soon appeared at the city gates;
and, destroying all with fire and sword, carried on
the siege of the Capitol with all imaginable fury.
At last, resolving on a general assault, they were
discovered by the cackling of geese; and as many
as had climbed the ramparts were driven down
by Manlius; when Camillus, setting upon them
in the rear with twenty thousand men he had got
together about the country, gave them a total overthrow.</p>

<p>The city, however, had been set on fire by the
barbarians, and so entirely demolished, that, upon
the return of the people, they resolved upon abandoning
the ruins, and seeking a more eligible abode
in the recently conquered city of Veii, a town already
built and well provided with all things. But this
being opposed by Camillus, they set to work with
such extraordinary diligence, that the vacant space
of the old city was quickly covered with new buildings,
and the whole finished within the short space of
one year. The Romans, however, on this occasion,
were in too great a hurry to think of either order or
regularity. The city was, therefore, rebuilt without
any reference to order; no care being taken to form
the streets in straight lines.</p>

<p>In this conflagration, all the public records were
burned; but there is no reason to believe, that it was
accompanied by any losses, which a lover of the arts
should mourn for. As many writers have remarked,
the Romans were not naturally a people of taste.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
They never excelled in the fine arts; and even their
own writers invariably allow, that they were indebted
for every thing that was elegant in the arts to the
people of Greece<a name="FNanchor_150_159" id="FNanchor_150_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_159" class="fnanchor">150</a>.</p>

<p>It is possible that, during the three hundred and
fifty years, which elapsed from the Gallic invasion
till the reign of Augustus, many magnificent buildings
may have been erected; but we have no evidence
that such was the case; and the few facts,
which we are enabled to glean from the pages of
ancient writers, are scarcely favourable to the supposition.
The commencement of the age of Roman
luxury is generally dated from the year 146 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span>,
when the fall of Carthage and of Corinth elevated
the power of the republic to a conspicuous height.
Yet, more than fifty years afterwards, no marble
columns had been introduced into any public buildings;
and the example of using them as decorations
of private houses was set by the orator Crassus, in
the beginning of the first century before the Christian
era.</p>

<p>The architectural splendour of the city must be
dated from the age of Augustus. &#8220;I found it of
brick,&#8221; he was accustomed to say; &#8220;I shall leave
it of marble.&#8221; Nor was he content with his own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>labours; at his instigation many private individuals
contributed to the embellishment of the capital.
The Pantheon, one of the noblest structures of
Rome, and several others, were the works of his
chief minister, Agrippa.</p>

<p>Tiberius and Caligula betrayed no wish to imitate
their predecessor; but several works of utility and
magnitude were completed under Claudius. Then
came, however, the emperor Nero; with whose reign
is associated that memorable conflagration, which
malice attributed to the Christians, and which raged
beyond all example of former ages. This fire left,
of the fourteen regions into which Augustus had
divided the city, only four parts untouched. It
was, therefore, fatal to many of the most venerable
fanes and trophies of the earlier ages. This conflagration
lasted from six to nine days. In the time
of Titus, too, another fire ravaged the city for three
days and nights; and in that of Trajan, another
conflagration consumed part of the Forum, and the
Golden House of Nero; after which few remains of
the ancient city were left; the rest being, to use the
language of Tacitus, &#8220;scanty relics, lacerated and
half-burned.&#8221;</p>

<p>The city, nevertheless, soon rose with fresh grandeur
and beauty from its ashes. Trajan performed
his part; and Hadrian followed with redoubled assiduity.
They were followed by the Antonines; and
so effective was the example they set, that most of
the more opulent senators of Rome deemed it an
honour, and almost an obligation, to contribute to
the glory and external splendour of their native city.
These monuments of architecture were adorned with
the finest and most beautiful productions of sculpture
and painting. Every quarter of Rome was filled with
temples, theatres, amphitheatres, porticoes, triumphal
arches, and aqueducts; with baths, and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
buildings, conducive to the health and pleasure, not
of the noble citizens only, but of the meanest.</p>

<p>The principal conquests of the Romans, were
achieved under the republic; and the emperors, for
the most part, were satisfied with preserving those
dominions which had been acquired by the policy of
the senate, the active emulation of the senators, and
the martial enthusiasm of the people. The seven
first centuries were filled with a rapid succession of
triumphs; but it was for Augustus, to relinquish
the ambitious design of subduing the whole earth,
and to introduce moderation into the public councils.
He bequeathed a valuable legacy to his successors,
the advice of confining the empire within those
limits which nature seemed to have placed as its
permanent bulwarks and boundaries:&mdash;on the west
the Atlantic ocean; the Rhine and Danube on the
north; the Euphrates on the east; and towards the
south the deserts of Africa and Arabia.</p>

<p>The first exception to this policy was the conquest
of Britain; the second the conquests of Trajan. It
was, however, revived by Hadrian; nearly the first
measure of whose reign was the resignation of all
that emperor&#8217;s eastern conquests.</p>

<p>The Roman empire, in the time of the Antonines,
was about two thousand miles in breadth, from the
wall of Antoninus and the northern limits of Dacia,
to Mount Atlas and the tropic of Cancer. It extended,
in length, more than three thousand miles,
from the Western Ocean to the Euphrates; it was
situated in the finest part of the temperate zone,
between the twenty-fourth and fifty-sixth degrees
of northern latitude; and it was supposed to
contain above sixteen hundred thousand square
miles, for the most part of fertile and well cultivated
land.</p>

<p>Pius studied the defence of the empire rather than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
the enlargement of it&mdash;a line of policy, which rendered
him more serviceable to the commonwealth than
the greatest conqueror. Marcus and Lucius (Antonini)
made the first division of the empire. At length it
was put up to public sale and sold to the highest
bidder. It was afterwards arrested in its ruin by
Alexander Severus. The fortunes of the empire,
after the progress of several successive tyrants, was
again restored by the courage, conduct, and extraordinary
virtues of Claudius the Second; to whom has
been attributed, with every probability of truth, the
courage of Trajan, the moderation of Augustus, and
the piety of Antoninus.</p>

<p>Then followed Aurelian, Tacitus, and Probus;
and Rome felt redeemed from the ruin that awaited
her: but Constantine laid the inevitable groundwork
of its destruction, by removing the imperial
throne to Byzantium. Rome became an easy prey
to her barbarian enemies; by whom she was several
times sacked, pillaged, and partially burned. The
most powerful of these enemies was Alaric:&mdash;the
people he had to conquer and take advantage
of, are thus described by Ammianus Marcellinus:&mdash;&#8220;Their
long robes of silk purple float in the wind,
and as they are agitated, by art or accident, they
occasionally discover the under-garments, the rich
tunics, embroidered with the figures of various
animals. Followed by a train of fifty servants, and
tearing up the pavement, they move along the street
with the same impetuous speed, as if they had travelled
with post-horses; and the example of the
senators is boldly imitated by the matrons and ladies,
whose covered-carriages are continually driving round
the immense space of the city and suburbs. Whenever
these persons of high distinction condescend to
visit the public baths, they assume, on their entrance,
a tone of loud and insolent command, and appropriate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
to their own use the conveniences which were designed
for the Roman people. As soon as they have indulged
themselves in the refreshments of the bath, they
resume their rings, and the other ensigns of their
dignity; select from their private wardrobe of the
finest linen, such as might suffice for a dozen persons,
the garments the most agreeable to their fancy, and
maintain till their departure the same haughty
demeanour, which, perhaps, might have been excused
in the great Marcellus, after the conquest of Syracuse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes, indeed, these heroes undertake more
arduous achievements; they visit their estates in
Italy, and procure themselves, by the toil of servile
hands, the amusements of the chase. If at any time,
but more especially on a hot day, they have courage
to sail in their painted galleys, from the Lucrine
Lake to their elegant villas on the sea-coast of Puteoli
and Cajeta, they compare their own expeditions to
the marches of Cæsar and Alexander. Yet, should a
fly presume to settle on the silken folds of their
gilded umbrellas; should a sun-beam penetrate
through some unregarded and imperceptible chink
they deplore their intolerable hardships, and lament,
in affected language, that they were not born in the
land of the Cimmerians, the regions of eternal darkness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such was the character of the nobles of Rome at
the period in which their city was taken possession of
by Alaric. As soon as the barbarian had got possession
of the Roman port, he summoned the city to
surrender at discretion; and his demands were
enforced by the positive declaration, that a refusal,
or even a delay, should be instantly followed by the
destruction of the magazines, on which the life of
the Roman people depended. The clamours of that
people, and the terror of famine, subdued the pride
of the senate. They listened without reluctance to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
the proposing of a new emperor on the throne of
Honorius; and the suffrage of the Gothic conqueror
bestowed the purple on Attalus, the præfect of the
city. Attalus was created emperor by the Goths
and Romans; he was, however, soon degraded by
Alaric, and Rome subjected to a general sack. The
conqueror no longer dissembled his appetite for plunder.
The trembling senate, without any hopes of
relief, prepared, by a desperate resistance, to delay
the ruin of their country. But they were unable to
guard against the secret conspiracy of their slaves
and domestics. At the hour of midnight, the Salarian
gate was opened, and the inhabitants were
awakened by the tremendous sound of the Gothic
trumpet. Eleven hundred and sixty-three years
after the foundation of Rome, the imperial city,
which had subdued and civilised so considerable a
part of mankind, was delivered to the licentious fury
of the tribes of Scythia and Germany. A cruel
slaughter was made of the Romans; the streets of the
city were filled with dead bodies, which, during the
consternation, remained unburied. The despair of
the inhabitants was sometimes converted into fury;
and whenever the barbarians were provoked by
opposition, they extended the promiscuous massacre
to the feeble, the innocent, and the helpless. The
private revenge of 40,000 slaves was exercised without
pity or remorse; and the ignominious lashes,
which they had formerly received, were washed away
in the blood of the guilty, or obnoxious families. The
matrons and virgins of Rome were exposed to injuries
more dreadful, in the apprehension of chastity,
than death itself.</p>

<p>When the portable riches had been seized, the
palaces were rudely stripped of their splendid and
costly furniture; the side-boards of massy plate, and
the variegated wardrobes of silk and purple, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
irregularly piled in the wagons, that always followed
the march of a Gothic army. The most exquisite
works of art were roughly handled, or wantonly
destroyed; many a statue was melted for the sake of
the precious materials; and many a vase, in the division
of the spoil, was shivered into fragments by the
stroke of the battle-axe. The sack lasted six days.</p>

<p>The edifices, too, of Rome received no small injury
from the violence of the Goths; but those injuries
appear to have been somewhat exaggerated. At their
entrance they fired a multitude of houses; and the
ruins of the palace of Sallust remained, in the age of
Justinian, a stately monument of the Gothic conflagration.
Procopius confines the fire to one peculiar
quarter; but adds, that the Goths ravaged the whole
city. Cassiodorus says, that many of the &#8220;wonders
of Rome,&#8221; were burned; and Olympiodorus speaks of
the infinite quantity of wealth, which Alaric carried
away. We collect, also, how great the disaster
was, when he tells us, that, on the retreat of the
Goths, 14,000 returned in one day.</p>

<p>The injury done by Genseric (<span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 455), is said
to have been not so great as that, perpetrated by the
Goths; yet most writers record that the Vandals and
Moors emptied Rome of most of her wealth. They
revenged the injuries of Carthage. The pillage lasted
fourteen days and nights; and all that yet remained
of public or private wealth, of sacred or profane
treasure, were transported to the vessels of Genseric.
Among the spoils, the splendid relics of two temples,
or rather of two religions, exhibited the remarkable
example of the vicissitude of human things. Since
the abolition of Paganism, the capital had been violated
and abandoned; yet the statues of the gods and
heroes were still respected, and the curious roof of
gilt bronze was reserved for the rapacious hands of
Genseric. The holy instruments of the Jewish worship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
had been ostentatiously displayed to the Roman
people, in the triumph of Titus. They were afterwards
deposited in the temple of Peace; and, at the
end of four hundred years, the spoils of Jerusalem
were transferred to Carthage, by a barbarian who
derived his origin from the shores of the Baltic. It
was difficult either to escape or to satisfy the avarice
of a conqueror, who possessed leisure to collect, and
ships to transport, the wealth of the capital. The
imperial ornaments of the palace, the magnificent
furniture and wardrobe, the sideboards of massy plate,
were accumulated with disorderly rapine; the gold
and silver amounted to several thousand talents; yet
even the brass and copper were laboriously removed.
The empress was rudely stripped of her jewels, and,
with her two daughters, the only surviving remains
of the great Theodosius, was compelled, as a captive,
to follow the haughty Vandal; who immediately
hoisted sail, and returned, with a prosperous navigation,
to the port of Carthage. Many thousand
Romans of both sexes, chosen for some useful or
agreeable qualifications, reluctantly embarked on
board the fleet of Genseric; and their distress was
aggravated by the unfeeling barbarian, who, in the
division of the booty, separated the wives from their
husbands, and the children from their parents.</p>

<p>The consequences of this Vandal invasion, to the
public and private buildings, are thus regarded by
the same authority (Gibbon):&mdash;&#8220;The spectator, who
casts a mournful view over the ruins of ancient Rome,
is tempted to accuse the memory of the Goths and
Vandals, for the mischief which they had neither the
leisure, nor power, nor perhaps the inclination, to
perpetrate. The tempests of war might strike some
lofty turrets to the ground; but the destruction which
undermined the foundations of those massy fabrics,
was prosecuted, slowly and silently, during a period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
of ten centuries. The decay of the city had gradually
impaired the value of the public works. The
circus and theatres might still excite, but they seldom
gratified, the desires of the people; the temples,
which had escaped the zeal of the Christians, were
no longer inhabited, either by gods or men; the
diminished crowds of the Romans were lost in the
immense space of their baths and porticoes; and the
stately libraries and halls of justice became useless
to an indolent generation, whose repose was seldom
disturbed, either by study or business. The monuments
of consular or imperial greatness were no
longer revered as the immortal glory of the capital;
they were only esteemed as an inexhaustible mine of
materials, cheaper and more convenient than the distant
quarry. Specious petitions were addressed to
the easy magistrates of Rome, which stated the want
of bricks or stones for some necessary service; the
fairest forms of architecture were rudely defaced for
the sake of some paltry or pretended repairs; and the
degenerate Romans, who converted the spoil to their
own emolument, demolished, with sacrilegious hands,
the labours of their ancestors.&#8221;</p>

<p>In 472 the city was sacked by Ricimer, who
enjoyed power under cover of the name of the
Emperor Libius Severus. His victorious troops,
breaking down every barrier, rushed with irresistible
violence into the heart of the city, and Rome was
subverted. The unfortunate emperor (Anthemius)
was dragged from his concealment, and inhumanly
massacred by the command of Ricimer his son-in-law;
who thus added a third, or perhaps a fourth,
emperor to the number of his victims. The soldiers,
who united the rage of factious citizens with the
savage manners of barbarians, were indulged, without
control, in the licence of rapine and murder; the
crowd of slaves and plebeians, who were unconcerned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
in the event, could only gain by the indiscriminate
pillage; and the face of the city exhibited the
strange contrast of stern cruelty and dissolute intemperance.
The sack of Rome by Ricimer is generally
overlooked by the apologists of the early
invaders; but it must not be forgotten, that they
were indulged in the plunder of all but two regions
of the city.</p>

<p>To Vitiges (about <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 540) must be ascribed the
destruction of the aqueducts, which rendered the
thermæ useless; and as these appear never to have
been frequented afterwards, their dilapidation must
be partially, but only partially, ascribed to the
Goths.</p>

<p>Vitiges burned every thing without the walls, and
commenced the desolation of the Campagna.</p>

<p>The last emperor of Rome was Augustulus.
Odoacer, king of the Heruli, entered Italy with a
vast multitude of barbarians, and having ravaged it,
at length approached Rome itself. The city made
no resistance; he therefore deposed Augustulus, and
took the dignity of empire on himself. From this
period the Romans lost all command in Italy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 479. Five centuries elapsed from the age
of Trajan and the Antonines, to the total extinction
of the Roman empire in the west. At that unhappy
period, the Saxons fiercely struggled with the natives
for the possession of Britain. Gaul and Spain were
divided between the powerful monarchies of the
Franks and Visigoths; and the dependent kingdoms
of the Suevi and Burgundians in Africa were exposed
to the cruel persecution of the Vandals, and
the savage insults of the Moors. Rome and Italy,
as far as the banks of the Danube, were afflicted by
an army of barbarian mercenaries, whose lawless
tyranny was succeeded by the reign of Theodoric,
the Ostrogoth. All the subjects of the empire, who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
by the use of the Latin language, more particularly
deserved the name and privileges of Romans, were
oppressed by the disgrace and calamities of foreign
conquest; and the victorious nations of Germany
established a new system of manners and government
in the western countries of Europe.</p>

<p>That Rome, however, did not always suffer from
the Goths, is evident from a passage in one of the
letters written by Cassiodorus, at one time minister
to Theodoric:&mdash;&#8220;The care of the Roman city is a
subject to which our thoughts are ever awake. For
what is there which it behoves us to provide for, more
worthy than the keeping up the repair of a city
which, it is evident, contains the ornaments of our
republic? therefore, let your illustrious highness
know, that we have appointed a notable person, on
account of its splendid Cloacæ, which are productive
of so much astonishment to beholders, that they may
well be said to surpass the wonders of other cities.
There thou mayest see flowing rivers, inclosed, as it
were, in hollow mountains. There thou mayest see
the rapid waters navigated by vessels, not without
some anxiety lest they should suffer shipwreck in the
precipitate torrent. Hence, O matchless Rome! it
may be inferred what greatness is in thee. For what
city may dare to contend with thy lofty superstructures,
when even thy lowest recesses can find no
parallel?&#8221;</p>

<p>In 546, Rome was besieged by Totila the Goth.
Having reduced, by force or treaty, the towns of
inferior note in the midland provinces of Italy,
Totila proceeded to besiege Rome. He took it
December 17th of the same year. On the loss of
the city, several persons,&mdash;some say five hundred,&mdash;took,
refuge in the church of St. Peter. As
soon as the daylight had displayed the victory of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
the Goths, their monarch visited the tomb of the
prince of the apostles; but while he prayed at the
altar, twenty-five soldiers and sixty citizens were put
to the sword in the vestibule of the temple. The
arch-deacon Pelagius stood before him with the
gospels in his hand.&mdash;&#8220;O Lord, be merciful to your
servant.&#8221; &#8220;Pelagius,&#8221; said Totila, with an insulting
smile, &#8220;your pride now condescends to become a
suppliant.&#8221; &#8220;I am a suppliant,&#8221; replied the prudent
arch-deacon; &#8220;God has now made us your subjects,
and, as your subjects, we are entitled to your clemency.&#8221;
At his humble prayer, the lives of the
Romans were spared; and the chastity of the maids
and matrons was preserved inviolate from the passions
of the hungry soldiers. But they were rewarded
by the freedom of pillage. The houses of
the senators were plentifully stored with gold and
silver. The sons and daughters of Roman consuls
tasted the misery which they had spurned or relieved,
wandered in tattered garments through the streets
of the city, and begged their bread before the gates
of their hereditary mansions.</p>

<p>Against the city he appeared inexorable. One
third of the walls was demolished by his command;
fire and engines prepared to consume or subvert the
most stately works of antiquity; and the world was
astonished by the fatal decree, that Rome should be
changed into &#8220;a pasture for cattle!&#8221; Belisarius, hearing
of this, wrote him a letter, in which he observed,
&#8220;That if Totila conquered, he ought, for his own
sake, to preserve a city, which would then be his
own by right of conquest, and would, at the same
time, be the most beautiful city in his dominions.
That it would be his own loss, if he destroyed it,
and redound to his utter dishonour. For Rome,
having been raised to so great a grandeur and majesty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
by the virtue and industry of former ages,
posterity would consider him as a common enemy of
mankind, in depriving them of an example and living
representation of their ancestors.&#8221;</p>

<p>In consequence of this letter, Totila permitting
his resolution to be diverted, signified to the ambassadors
of Belisarius, that he should spare the city;
and he stationed his army at the distance of one
hundred and twenty furlongs, to observe the motions
of the Roman general. With the remainder of his
forces, he occupied, on the summit of Gargarus, one
of the camps of Hannibal. The senators were dragged
in his train, and afterwards confined in the fortresses
of Campagna. The citizens, with their wives and
children, were dispersed in exile; and, during forty
days, Rome was abandoned to desolate and dreary
solitude.</p>

<p>Totila is known to have destroyed a third part
of the walls; and although he desisted from his meditated
destruction of every monument, the extent
of the injury inflicted by that conqueror may have
been greater than is usually supposed. Procopius
affirms, that he did burn &#8220;not a small portion of
the city,&#8221; especially beyond the Tiber. One of the
authors of the Chronicles records a fire, and the
total abandonment of the city for more than forty
days; and it must be mentioned, that there is no
certain trace of the palace of the Cæsars having
survived the irruption of Totila.</p>

<p>With Totila, the dilapidation of Rome by the
barbarians is generally allowed to terminate.</p>

<p>The incursion of the Lombards in 578 and 593
completed the desolation of the Campagna; but did
not affect the city itself.</p>

<p>Their king Luitprand (in 741) has been absolved
from a supposed violence; but Astolphus (in 754)
did assault the city violently; and whatever structures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
were near the walls must be supposed to have
suffered from the attack.</p>

<p>From that period, Rome was not forcibly entered,
that is not after a siege, until the fall of the Carlovingian
race, when it was defended in the name of
the emperor Lambert; and assaulted and taken by
barbarians, commanded by Arnulphus, son of Carloman
of Bavaria (<span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 896).</p>

<p>It would exceed our limits were we to enter into
a detail of the various causes, which were so long at
work in effecting the ruin of the ancient monuments
of Rome. If we except the Pantheon, the ancient
remains have been so mutilated and destroyed, that
even the name is, in many cases, doubtful. If a person,
says Dr. Burton, expects to find at Rome such
magnificent remains, as he has read of in Athens, he
will be grievously disappointed. It is highly necessary
to know, that whatever exists at Rome as a
monument of ancient times has suffered from various
calamities.</p>

<p>Gibbon states four causes of decay:&mdash;The injuries
of time and nature; the hostile attacks of the barbarians
and christians; the use and abuse of the
materials; and the domestic quarrels of the Romans.
There is great truth in Pope&#8217;s remark&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Some felt the silent strokes of mouldering age;</span>
<span class="i0">Some hostile fury; some religious rage;</span>
<span class="i0">Barbarian blindness, Christian zeal conspire,</span>
<span class="i0">And Papal piety, and Gothic fire.</span>
</div></div>

<p>The injuries done by the Christian clergy to the
architectural beauty of Rome, may be divided into
two kinds: those, which were commanded, or connived
at, by the Romans, for useful repairs or constructions;
and those, which were encouraged or
permitted from motives of fanaticism.</p>

<p>In the year 426, during the reign of Theodosius
the Younger, there was a great destruction of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
temples and fanes. &#8220;The destruction of the idolatrous
fanes,&#8221; says an ecclesiastical writer, &#8220;was
from the foundation; and so complete, that we cannot
perceive a vestige of the former superstition. Their
temples are so destroyed, that the appearance of their
form no longer remains; nor can those of our times
recognise the shape of their altars. As for their
materials, they are dedicated to the fanes of the
martyrs. Temples are not found among the wonders
admired by Theodoric, except the half-stripped
Capitoline fane is to be enumerated; and Procopius
confines his notices to the Temple of Peace, and to
the Temple of Janus. In the reign of Justinian, the
temples were partly in private hands, and, therefore,
not universally protected as public edifices. Pagan
structures would naturally suffer more at the first
triumph of Christianity than afterwards, when the
rage and the merit of destruction must have diminished.
It is not then rash to believe, that many
temples were destroyed or despoiled, and the materials
employed to the honour of the new religion.
Du Barga asserts that there were marks on the
obelisks of their having been all overthrown, with
the exception of one, which was not dedicated to any
of the false gods of antiquity.&#8221;</p>

<p>The destruction of the baths are attributed to the
same piety, and those of Diocletian and Caracalla
showed, in the eighth century, evident marks of
human violence. Pope Gregory III. employed nine
columns of some ancient building for the church of St.
Peter. The rebuilding of the city walls by four popes,
in the same century, was a useful but a destructive
operation. Pope Hadrian I. threw down an immense
structure of Tiburtine stone to enlarge the
church of St. Maria in Cosmedin. Donus I. had before
(<span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 676) stripped the marble from a large
pyramid, generally known by the name of Scipio&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
Tomb. Paul II. employed the stones of the Coliseum
to build a palace. Sixtus IV. took down the
Temple of Hercules, and destroyed the remains of an
ancient bridge to make four hundred cannon-balls for
the castle of St. Angelo. Paul III. and his nephews
laboured incessantly at the quarry of the Coliseum.
He devastated, also, many other buildings. Sixtus
V. threw down several statues still remaining in the
capital. Urban VIII. took off the bronze from the
portico of the Pantheon, and some of the base of the
sepulchre of Cecilia Metella; and Paul V. removed
the entablature and pediment of a structure in the
Forum of Nerva, and also the remaining column of
the Temple of Peace. Lastly, Alexander VII.
took down the arch called &#8220;di Portogallo,&#8221; in order
to widen the Corso. The inferior clergy, too, were
great depredators; insomuch that a volume of no
inconsiderable size has been composed by one of their
own order to enumerate the Pagan materials applied
to the use of the church.</p>

<p>It is difficult to say where this system of depredation
would have stopped, had not Benedict XIV.
erected a cross in the centre of the arena, and declared
the place sacred, out of respect to the blood of the
many martyrs who had been butchered there during
the persecution. This declaration, if issued two or
three centuries before, would have preserved the
Coliseum entire; it can now only protect its remains,
and transmit them in their present state to
posterity.</p>

<p>Conflagrations, also, contributed to the destruction
of the city. In 312 the temple of Fortuna was
burned down. The palaces of Symmachus and Lampadius,
with the baths of Constantine, suffered by
the same cause.</p>

<p>Nor must the destruction be confined to one element.
The Tiber rose, not unfrequently, to the walls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
and many inundations are recorded. Indeed, even
so early as the second siege of the city by Totila,
there was so much uncultivated land within the
walls, that Diogenes, the governor, thought the
corn, he had sown, would be sufficient to supply
the garrison and citizens in a protracted defence.</p>

<p>It is impossible to assign a precise date to the
total destruction of the greater portion of the ancient
site; but the calamities of the seventh and eighth
centuries must have contributed to, if they did not
complete, the change. A scarcity in the year 604,
a violent earthquake a few years afterwards, a
pestilence in or about the year 678, five great inundations
of the Tiber from 680 to 797, a second
famine in the pontificate of Pope Constantine, which
lasted thirty-six months, a pestilence in the last
year of the seventh century, and the assault of the
Lombards for three months in 755;&mdash;these are the
events which compose the Roman history of this
unhappy period.</p>

<p>Added to all this, the importance of the new
city accelerated the ruin of the old; and great
was the destruction during the periods in which
separate parties fought their battles in the public
streets, after the restoration of the empire of the
West; in which we must record the ruin, caused by
Robert Guiscard, which proved more injurious to
the remains of Rome, from 1082 to 1084, than all
the preceding barbarians of every age: for the
Normans and Saracens of his army, with the papal
faction, burned the town from the Flaminian
gate to the Antonine column, and laid waste the
sides of the Esquiline to the Lateran; thence he set
fire to the region from that church to the Coliseum
and the Capitol. He attacked the Coliseum for
several days, and finished the ruin of the Capitol.</p>

<p>A cotemporary writer says, that all the regions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
the city were ruined; and another spectator, who
was in Rome twelve years afterwards, laments that
although what remained could not be equalled&mdash;what
was ruined, could never be repaired.</p>

<span class="i10"><span class="smcap">Spenser&#8217;s</span> <i>Ruins of Rome</i>.</span>
</div></div>

<p>In the annals for 1167, we find that the German
Barbarossa assaulted the Vatican for a week, and that
the Pope saved himself in the Capitol. The Colonna
were driven from the mausoleum of Augustus. After
the Popes had begun to yield in the unequal contest
with the senators and people, and had ceased to be
constantly in the capital, the field was left open for
the wars of the senators; that is, of the nobles themselves.
The Colonna and Ursini then appear among
the destroyers of the city. In 1291, a civil war
occurred, which lasted six months; the issue of which
was, according to a spectator, that Rome was reduced
to the condition of a town &#8220;besieged, bombarded and
burned.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the period in which Henry VII. was crowned
Emperor, battles were fought in every quarter of the
city. The fall of houses, indeed, the fire, the slaughter,
the ringing of the bells from the churches, the
shouts of the combatants, and the clanging of arms,
the Roman people rushing from all quarters towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
the Capitol; this universal uproar attended the
coronation of the new Cæsar, and the Cardinals apprehended
the total destruction of the city.</p>

<p>The absence of the Popes, also, from the year
1360 to 1376, has been esteemed peculiarly calamitous
to the ancient fabrics. Petrarch was overwhelmed
with regret. He complained that the
ruins were in danger of perishing; that the nobles
were the rivals of time and the ancient Barbarians;
and that the columns and precious marbles
of Rome were devoted to the decoration of
the slothful metropolis of their Neapolitan rivals.
Yet, it appears that these columns and marbles
were taken from palaces comparatively modern,
from the thresholds of churches, from the shrines
of sepulchres, from structures to which they had
been conveyed from their original state, and finally,
from ruins actually fallen. The solid masses of
antiquity are not said to have suffered from this spoliation;
and the edifices, whose impending ruin affected
Petrarch, were the sacred basilicas, then converted
into fortresses.</p>

<p>The great earthquake of 1349 operated, also, in a
very destructive manner; several ancient ornaments
being thrown down; and an inundation of the Tiber
is recorded among the afflictions of the times. The
summits of the hills alone were above the water;
and the lower grounds were for eight days converted
into a lake.</p>

<p>The return of the Popes was the signal of renewed
violence. The Colonna and Ursini, the people and
the church, fought for the Capitol and towers; and
the forces of the Popes repeatedly bombarded the
town.</p>

<p>During the great schism of the West, the hostile
entries of Ladislaus of Naples, and the tumultuous
government of the famous Perugian, Braccio Montone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
despoiled the tomb of Hadrian, and doubtless other
monuments. Yet that violence is supposed to have
been less pernicious than the peaceful spoliation
which succeeded the extinction of the schism of
Martin V, in 1417; and the suppression of the last
revolt of the Romans by his successor Eugenius IV,
in 1434: for from that epoch is dated the consumption
of such marble or travertine, as might either be
stripped with facility from the stone monuments,
or be found in isolated fragments.</p>

<p>We now give place to a description of what remained
in the time of Poggio Bracciolini. Besides a
bridge, an arch, a sepulchre, and the pyramid of
Cestius, he could discern, of the age of the republic, 1,
a double row of vaults, in the salt-office of the Capitol,
which were inscribed with the name and munificence
of Catullus. 2, Eleven temples were visible, in some
degree, from the perfect form of the Pantheon to the
three arches and a marble column of the temple of
Peace, which Vespasian erected after the civil wars
and the Jewish triumph. 3, Of the public baths,
none were sufficiently entire to represent the use and
distribution of the several parts; but those of Diocletian
and Caracalla still retained the titles of the
founders, and astonished the curious spectator; who,
in observing their solidity and extent, the variety of
marbles, the size and multitude of the columns, compared
the labour and expense with the use and the importance.
Of the baths of Constantine, of Alexander,
of Domitian, or rather of Titus, some vestige might
yet be found. 4, The triumphal arches of Titus,
Severus, and Constantine were entire, both the structures
and the inscriptions; a falling fragment was
honoured with the name of Trajan; and two arches
were still extant in the Flaminian way. 5, After the
wonder, of the Coliseum, Poggio might have overlooked
a small amphitheatre of brick, most probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
for the use of the Prætorian camp: the theatres of
Marcellus and Pompey were occupied, in a great
measure, by public and private buildings; and in
the Circus Agonalis and Maximus, little more than
the situation and the form could be investigated.
6, The columns of Trajan and Antonine were still
erect; but the Egyptian obelisks were broken or buried.
A people of gods and heroes, the workmanship of
art, was reduced to one equestrian figure of gilt brass,
and to five marble statues, of which the most conspicuous
were the two horses of Phidias and Praxiteles.
7, The two mausoleums or sepulchres of
Augustus and Hadrian could not totally be lost;
but the former was visible only as a mound of earth;
and the latter, the castle of St. Angelo, had acquired
the name and appearance of a modern fortress. With
the addition of some separate and nameless columns,
such were the remains of the ancient city.</p>

<p>In the intervals between the two visits of Poggio
to Rome, the cell, and part of the Temple of Concord,
and the base of the tomb of Metella, were
ground to lime; also a portico near the Minerva.
Poggio&#8217;s description of the ruins, it may be observed,
is not sufficiently minute or correct to supply the
deficiency of his contemporary Blondus; but we may
distinctly mark, that the site of ancient Rome had
arrived at the desolation in which it is seen at the
present day. The Rome of the lower and middle
ages was a mass of irregular lanes, built upon or
amongst ruins, and surmounted by brick towers,
many of them on ancient basements. The streets
were so narrow, that two horsemen could ride
abreast. Two hundred houses, three towers, and
three churches, choked up the forum of Trajan. The
reformation of Sixtus IV., and the embellishments of
his successors, have obliterated this town, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
which is now seen is a capital, which can only date
from the end of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>Not long before the imperialists carried Rome, the
Colonnas, in 1526, sacked it, as it were; and that
was followed by that of the Abate di Farfa, and the
peasantry of the Orsini family<a name="FNanchor_151_160" id="FNanchor_151_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_160" class="fnanchor">151</a>.</p>

<p>Rome was assaulted by the Bourbon, May 5,
1527; and the imperialists left it February 17, 1528.</p>

<p>No sooner was the Bourbon in sight of Rome, than
he harangued his troops, and pointed to the end of
all their sufferings. Being destitute of artillery, with
which he might batter the walls, he instantly made
his dispositions for an assault; and having discovered
a breach, he planted, with his own hands, a
ladder against the rampart, and prepared to mount
it, followed by his German bands. But, at that
instant, a shot, discharged from the first arquebuse
which was fired, terminated at once his life and his
misfortunes. Much fruitless inquiry has been made
to ascertain the author of his death, which is commonly
attributed to a priest; but Benvenuto Cellini,
so well known by his extraordinary adventures and
writings, lays claim to the merit of killing this hero.
By whatever hand he fell he preserved, even in the
act of expiring, all his presence as well as greatness
of mind. He no sooner felt himself wounded, than
he ordered a Gascon captain, named Jonas, to cover
him with a cloak, in order to conceal his death, lest
it should damp the courage of his soldiers. Jonas
executed his commands with punctuality. The Constable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
still continued to breathe when the city was
taken. He was, therefore, carried thither, and there
expired, May 5, 1527, at thirty-eight years of age.</p>

<p>Philipart, prince of Orange, contrived to keep the
troops in ignorance of their commander&#8217;s death, till
they were masters of Rome; and then, to render
them inaccessible to pity, he revealed to them the
fate of Bourbon. No language can express the fury
with which they were animated at this sad intelligence.
They rent the air with the cries of &#8220;Carné,
carné! Sangre, sangre! Bourbon, Bourbon!&#8221;</p>

<p>The imagination is appalled at the bare recital of the
wanton outrages on human nature, which were committed
by Bourbon&#8217;s army, during the time that they
remained masters of Rome. The pillage lasted, without
any interruption, for two months.</p>

<p>Never had that proud city suffered from her barbarian
conquerors, in the decline of the Roman empire,&mdash;from
Alaric, from Genseric, or from Odoacer,&mdash;the
same merciless treatment as she underwent from the
rage of the imperial troops;&mdash;the subjects, or the soldiers
of a Catholic king! Rapacity, lust, and impiety,
were exhausted by these men. Roman ladies of the
noblest extraction were submitted to the basest and
vilest prostitution. The sacred ornaments of the
sacerdotal, and even of the pontifical dignity, were
converted to purposes of ridicule and buffoonery.
Priests, nay even bishops and cardinals, were degraded
to the brutal passions of the soldiery; and
after having suffered every ignominy of blows, mutilation,
and personal contumely, were massacred in
pastime. Exorbitant ransoms were exacted repeatedly
from the same persons; and when they had
no longer wherewithal to purchase life, they were
butchered without mercy. Nuns, virgins, matrons,
were publicly devoted to the infamous appetites of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
the soldiers; who first violated, and then stabbed,
the victims of their pleasures. The streets were
strewed with the dead; and it is said that eight thousand
young women, of all ranks and conditions, were
found to be pregnant within five months from the
sack of the unfortunate city.</p>

<p>Three years after the sack by Bourbon, that is in
1530, an inundation of the Tiber ruined a multitude
of edifices both public and private, and was
almost equally calamitous with the sack of Rome.
Simond, writing from Rome in January 1818, says:
&#8220;The Tiber has been very high, and the lower
parts of the town under water; yet this is nothing
compared with the inundations recorded on two pillars
at the port of Ripetta, a sort of landing-place.
The mark on one of them is full eighteen feet above
the level of the adjoining streets; and, considering
the rapidity of the stream, a great part of the city
must then have been in imminent danger of being
swept away.&#8221; In 1819 the Pantheon was flooded;
but this is not an uncommon event, as it stands near
the river, and the drain, which should carry off the
rain-water that falls through the aperture in the top,
communicates with the stream. The inundations of
the Tiber, indeed, are one of the causes, which combined
to destroy so many of the monuments of Rome
during the middle ages. There is one recorded in
1345, among the afflictions of the times, when only
the summits of the hills were above the water, and
the lower grounds were converted into a lake for the
space of eight days. Several floods are mentioned by
the ancient writers; and Tacitus speaks of a project
which was debated in the senate, <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 15, for diverting
some of the streams running into the Tiber, but
which was not carried into execution in consequence
of the petitions of various towns, who sent deputies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
to oppose it; partly on the ground of their local
interests being affected, and partly from a feeling of
superstition, which emboldened them to urge that
&#8220;Nature had assigned to rivers their proper courses,&#8221;
and other reasons of a similar nature.</p>

<p>Aurelian endeavoured to put an effectual stop to the
calamities which sprang from the lawless river, by
raising its banks and clearing its channel. However,
the deposits resulting from these frequent inundations
have contributed greatly to that vast accumulation of
soil, which has raised the surface of modern Rome so
many feet above the ancient level; and thus the evil
itself has occasioned a remedy to a partial extent.</p>

<p>We must now close this portion of our imperfect
account, and proceed to give our readers some idea
in respect to the present condition of Rome&#8217;s ancient
remains; gleaned, for the most part, from the pages
of writers who have recently been sojourners in &#8220;the
Eternal City:&#8221; but in doing this we by no means
wish our readers to expect the full and minute particulars,
which they may find in works entirely dedicated
to the subject; for Rome, even in its antiquities,
would require a volume for itself.</p>

<p>When Poggio Bracciolini visited Rome in the
fifteenth century, he complained that nothing of old
Rome subsisted entire, and that few monuments of
the free city remained; and many writers of more
recent times have made the same complaint. &#8220;The
artist,&#8221; says Sir John Hobhouse, &#8220;may be comparatively
indifferent to the date and history, and regard
chiefly the architectural merit of a structure; but
the Rome which the Florentine republican regretted,
and which an Englishman would wish to find, is not
that of Augustus and his successors, but of those
greater and better men, of whose heroic actions his
earliest impressions are composed.&#8221; To which, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
may be added what Dr. Burton questions,
viz., Whether, in his expectations, the traveller may
not betray his ignorance of real history. &#8220;The works
of the Romans, in the early ages of their nation,
were remarkable for their solidity and strength; but
there seems no reason to suppose that much taste or
elegance was displayed in them. But then, again, if
we wish to confine ourselves to the republic, there is
surely no need of monuments of brick and stone to
awaken our recollections of such a period. If we must
have visible objects on which to fix our attention, we
have the ground itself on which the Romans trod; we
have the Seven Hills; we have the Campus Martius,
the Forum,&mdash;all places familiar to us from history, and
in which we can assign the precise spot where some
memorable action was performed. Those who feel
a gratification, by placing their footsteps where
Cicero or Cæsar did before them, in the consciousness
of standing upon the same hill which Manlius defended,
and in all those associations which bring the
actors themselves upon the scene, may have all
their enthusiasm satisfied, and need not complain
that there are no monuments of the time of the
republic.&#8221;</p>

<p>The remains of ancient Rome may be classed in
three different periods. Of the first, the works of
the kings, embracing a period of two hundred and
forty-four years, from the foundation of the city by
Romulus to the expulsion of Tarquin, very little
have escaped the ravages of time; the Tullian walls
and prison, with the Cloaca Maxima, being the only
identified remains. Of the works of the republic,
which lasted four hundred and sixty-one years,
although the city, during that period, was more than
once besieged, burned, and sacked, many works are
yet extant:&mdash;the military ways and aqueducts, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
some small temples and tombs. But it was during the
third period, that of the emperors, that Rome attained
the meridian of her glory. For three centuries all the
known world was either subject to her, or bound by
commercial treaties; and the taste and magnificence of
the Romans were displayed in the erection of temples
to the gods, triumphal arches and pillars to conquerors,
amphitheatres, palaces, and other works of
ostentation and luxury, for which architecture was
made to exhaust her treasures, and no expense was
spared to decorate.</p>

<p>Architecture was unknown to the Romans until
Tarquin came down from Etruria. Hence the few
works of the kings, which still remain, were built in
the Etruscan style, with large uncemented, but regular
blocks. In the gardens of the convent Giovanni
a S. Paolo is a ruin of the Curia Hostilia, called
the Rostrum of Cicero; and some few fragments,
also, remain of a bridge, erected by Ancus Martius.
On this bridge (Pons Sublicius) Horatius Cocles opposed
singly the army of Porsenna; and from it,
in subsequent times, the bodies of Commodus and
Heliogabalus were thrown into the Tiber. In the
pontificate of Nicholas V. it was destroyed by an
inundation. There are also the remains of a large
brick edifice, supposed to have been the Curia,
erected by Tullus Hostilius, which was destroyed by
fire when the populace burned in it the corpse of Clodius.
Julius Cæsar commenced its restoration; and
Augustus finished it, and gave it the name of Curia
Julia, in honour of his father by adoption.</p>

<p>In regard to the form and size of the city, we must
follow the direction of the seven hills upon which it
was built. 1. Of these <span class="smcap">Mons Palatinus</span> has always
had the preference. It was in this place that Romulus
laid the foundation of the city, in a quadrangular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
form; and here the same king and Tullus
Hostilius kept their courts, as did Augustus afterwards,
and all the succeeding emperors. This hill
was in compass 1200 paces. 2. <span class="smcap">Mons Tarpeius</span>,
took its name from Tarpeia, a Roman virgin, who in
this place betrayed the city to the Sabines. It had
afterwards the denomination of Capitolinus, from the
head of a man, casually found here in digging for the
foundation of the temple of Jupiter. This hill was
added to the city by Titus Tatius, king of the Sabines;
when, having been first overcome in the field
by Romulus, he and his subjects were permitted to
incorporate with the Romans. 3. <span class="smcap">Mons Esquilinus</span>
was taken in by Servius Tullius, who had here
his royal seat. 4. <span class="smcap">Mons Viminalis</span> derived its name
from the osiers that grew very plentifully upon it.
This hill was taken in by Servius Tullus. 5. <span class="smcap">Mons
C&#339;lius</span> owes its name to C&#339;lius, or C&#339;les, a Tuscan
general greatly celebrated in his time, who pitched
his tents here when he came to the assistance of
Romulus against the Sabines. Its having been taken
into the city is attributed to Tullus Hostilius, by
Livy and Dionysius; but by Strabo, to Ancus
Martius. 6. <span class="smcap">Collis Quirinalis</span> was so called from
the temple of Quirinus, another name of Romulus; or
from the Curetes, a people that removed hither from
a Sabine city, called Cures. It afterwards changed
its name to Caballus, Mons Caballi, and Caballinus,
from the two marble horses, with each a man holding
him, which are set up here. They are still
standing, and, if the inscription on the pilasters be
true, were the work of Phidias and Praxiteles; made
by those masters to represent Alexander and his
horse Bucephalus, and sent to Nero as a present by
Tiridates king of Armenia. 7. <span class="smcap">Mons Aventinus</span>
derived its name from Aventinus, an Alban king,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
from the river Avens, or from (ab Avibus) the birds,
that used to flock there from the Tiber. Gellius
affirms, that this hill was not enclosed within the
bounds of the city, till the time of Claudius; but
Eutropius expressly states that it was taken into it
even so early as that of Ancus Martius.</p>

<p>As to the extent of the whole city, the greatest,
recorded in history, was in the reign of Valerian,
who enlarged the walls to such a degree, as to surround
a space of fifty miles. The number of inhabitants,
in its flourishing state, is computed by
Lipsius at four millions. The present extent of the
walls is about thirteen miles. Sir John Hobhouse
walked round them in three hours, thirty-three
minutes and three quarters; and Dr. Burton did
the same in three hours and ten minutes.</p>

<p>This circuit will bring into view specimens of every
construction, from the days of Servius Tullius down
to the present. Aurelian took into his walls whatever
he found standing in their line, and they now include
some remains of the Tullian walls, the walls of the
Prætorian barracks, the facing of a tank, aqueducts,
sepulchral monuments, a menagerie, an amphitheatre,
a pyramid, &amp;c. Thus do they exhibit the uncemented
blocks of the Etruscan style, the reticular work of
the republic, the travertine preferred by the first
emperors, the alternate tufa and bricks employed by
their successors, and that poverty of materials which
marks the declining empire. Since the first breach,
made by Totila, the walls have been often and variously
repaired; sometimes by a case of brick-work,
filled up with shattered marbles, rubble, shard, and
mortar. In some parts, the cementitious work is
unfaced; here you find stones and tufa mixed; there
tufa alone, laid in the Saracenic manner: the latter repairs
have the brick revêtement of modern fortification.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>The gates of Rome, at the present day, are sixteen
in number, of which only twelve are open. The
wall of Romulus had but three or four; and there
has been much discussion among antiquaries, as to
their position. That of Servius had seven; but in
the time of Pliny, (in the middle of the first century)
there were no less than thirty-seven gates to
the city. The twelve gates at present in use correspond
to some of the principal gates of former
times.</p>

<p>Modern Rome, however, can scarcely be said to
rest upon the ancient base. Scarcely two-thirds of the
space within the walls are now inhabited, and the
most thickly peopled district is comprised within
what was anciently the open plain of the Campus
Martius. On the other hand the most populous
part of the ancient Rome is now but a landscape;
it would almost seem, indeed, as if the city had
slipped off its seven hills into the plain beneath. A
remarkable change, too, has taken place in the surface
of the site itself. In the valleys the ground has
been raised not less than fourteen or fifteen feet.
This is strikingly observable in the Forum, where
there has been a great rise above the ancient level,
owing partly to the accumulation of soil and rubbish
brought down by the rains; but chiefly, as there is
reason to believe, to that occasioned by the demolition
of ancient buildings, and the practice which
prevailed of erecting new structures upon the prostrate
ruins.</p>

<p>The Tiber, too, still remains; but its present appearance
has been variously estimated. &#8220;The Tiber,&#8221;
says Dr. Burton, &#8220;is a stream of which classical
recollections are apt to raise too favourable anticipations.
When we think of the fleets of the capital
of the world sailing up it, and pouring in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
treasures of tributary kingdoms, we are likely to
attach to it ideas of grandeur and magnificence.
But if we come to the Tiber with such expectations,
our disappointment will be great.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir John Hobhouse speaks differently: &#8220;Arrived
at the bank of the Tiber,&#8221; he says, speaking of the
traveller&#8217;s approach to Rome from the north, across
the Ponte Molle, &#8220;he does not find the muddy
insignificant stream, which the disappointments of
overheated imaginations have described it; but one
of the finest rivers of Europe, now rolling through
a vale of gardens, and now sweeping the base of
swelling acclivities, clothed with wood, and crowned
with villas, and their evergreen shrubberies.&#8221; Notwithstanding
this, the Tiber can be by no means
called a large river, and it is scarcely navigable even
below Rome, owing to the frequent shoals which
impede its course. A steam-boat, which plies between
the capital and Fiumicino, a distance of about
sixteen miles, is generally five or six hours in making
the passage. Ordinary vessels are three days in
making their way up the Tiber to Rome; being
towed up always by buffaloes. The velocity of its
current may be estimated from the fact, that it deposits
its coarser gravel thirty miles from the city,
and its finer at twelve; it hence pursues its course
to the sea, charged only with a fine yellowish sand,
imparting to its waters that peculiar colour, which
poets call golden, and travellers muddy. Yet these
waters enjoyed, at one time, a high reputation for
sweetness and salubrious qualities. Pope Paul the
Third invariably carried a supply of the water of the
Tiber with him on his longest journeys; and his
predecessor, Clement the Seventh, was similarly provided,
by order of his physician, when he repaired
to Marseilles, to celebrate the marriage of his niece,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
Catherine de Medici, with the brother of the Dauphin,
afterwards Henry the Second of France.</p>

<p>Both within and without the walls of Rome, fragments
of aqueducts may be seen. Of these &#8220;some,&#8221;
says Mr. Woods, &#8220;are of stone, others of brick-work,
but the former cannot be traced for any continuance;
and while two or three are sometimes supported
on a range of arches, in other places almost
every one seems to have a range to itself. It is
curious to trace these repairs, executed, perhaps, fifteen
centuries ago. The execution of the brick-work,
in most instances, or perhaps in all, shows them to
be decidedly prior to the age of Constantine; and
the principal restorations, in all probability, took
place when the upper water-courses were added.
They generally consist of brick arches, built within
the ancient stone ones; sometimes resting on the old
piers, but more often carried down to the ground;
and, in some cases, the whole arch has been filled
up, or only a mere door-way left at the bottom.
Sometimes this internal work has been wholly, or
partially, destroyed; and sometimes the original
stone-work has disappeared, as the owner of the
ground happened to want bricks, or squared stones.
In one place the ancient piers have been entirely
buried in the more recent brick-work; but the brick-work
has been broken, and the original stone-work
taken away: presenting a very singular, and, at first
sight, wholly unaccountable appearance. In other
parts, the whole has fallen, apparently without
having had these brick additions; for a range of
parallel mounds mark the situation of the prostrated
piers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know any thing more striking,&#8221; says
Simond, &#8220;than these endless arches of Roman aqueducts,
pursuing, with great strides, their irregular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
course over the desert. They suggest the idea of
immensity, of durability, of simplicity, of boundless
power, reckless of cost and labour, all for a useful
purpose, and regardless of beauty. A river in mid-air,
which had been flowing on ceaselessly for fifteen
or eighteen hundred, or two thousand years, poured
its cataracts in the streets and public squares of Rome,
when she was mistress, and also when she was the
slave of nations; and quenched the thirst of Attila,
and of Genseric, as it had before quenched that of
Brutus and Cæsar, and as it has since quenched that
of beggars and of popes. During those ages of desolation
and darkness, when Rome had almost ceased
to be a city, this artificial river ran to waste among
the ruins; but now fills again the numerous and
magnificent fountains of the modern city. Only
three out of eleven of these ancient aqueducts remain
entire, and in a state to conduct water; what, then,
must have been the profusion of water to ancient
Rome?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Tarpeian rock still exists; but has little in its
appearance to gratify the associations of a classic traveller.
Seneca describes it as it existed in his time
thus:&mdash;&#8220;A lofty and precipitous mass rises up, rugged
with many rocks, which either bruise the body to
death, or hurry one down still more violently. The
points projecting from the sides, and the gloomy
prospect of its vast height, are truly horrid. This
place is chosen in particular, that the criminals may
not require to be thrown down more than once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poggio Bracciolini gives a melancholy picture of
what, in his time, was the state of this celebrated
rock. &#8220;This Tarpeian rock was a savage and solitary
thicket. In the time of the poet it was covered
with the golden roofs of a temple; the temple is overthrown,
the gold has been pillaged, the wheel of
fortune has accomplished her revolution, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
sacred ground is again disfigured with thorns and
brambles. The hill of the Capitol, on which we sit,
was formerly the head of the Roman empire, the
citadel of the earth, the terror of kings; illustrated
by the footsteps of so many triumphs, enriched with
the spoils and attributes of so many nations. This
spectacle of the world, how is it fallen! how changed!
how defaced! The path of victory is obliterated
by vines, and the benches of the senators are concealed
by a dunghill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like the modern Tiber, the modern Tarpeian,&#8221;
says an elegant traveller, &#8220;is little able to bear the
weight of its ancient reputation.&#8221; &#8220;The only precipice
that remains,&#8221; says another traveller (Mathews)
&#8220;is one about thirty feet from the point of a wall,
where you might leap down on the dung, mixed in
the fold below, without any fear of breaking your
bones.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Aqueducts were, beyond all question, some
of the noblest designs of the Romans. Frontinus, a
Roman author, and a person of consular dignity, who
compiled a treatise on this subject, affirms them to
be the clearest token of the grandeur of the empire.
The first invention of them is attributed to Appius
Claudius, <span class="smcap lowercase">A. U. C.</span> 441, who brought water into the city
by a channel eleven miles in length. But this was very
inconsiderable compared to those that were afterwards
carried on by the emperors and other persons; several
of which were cut through the mountains, and all
other impediments, for above forty miles together;
and of such height, that a man on horseback, as Procopius
informs us, might ride through them without
the least difficulty. This, however, is meant only of
the constant course of the channel; for the vaults and
arches were, in some places, 109 feet high.</p>

<p>Procopius makes the Aqueducts only fourteen;
but Aurelius Victor has enlarged the number to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
twenty. The Claudian Aqueduct conveyed 800,000
tons of water each day into the city.</p>

<p>The Forums of Rome were of two kinds; one a
place of popular assembly, both for business, and
pleasure; serving at once the purposes of what we
call an Exchange, certain courts of justice, and of
hustings for the election of public functionaries: the
other consisted of market-places. The chief forum
was emphatically called the Roman, or the Great
Forum.</p>

<p>The second forum, built in Rome, was erected by
Julius Cæsar. The third was called sometimes the
Augustan, from its having been formed by Augustus;
and sometimes the Forum of Mars from the temple
of that god, erected by him. Some remains are still
in existence. The fourth forum was begun by Domitian,
but being finished by Nerva, it was called after
his name. A fifth forum was built by the emperor
Trajan; said to have been the most celebrated work
of the kind in the city. It was built with the
spoils he had taken in his wars. The roof was of
brass.</p>

<p>Ammianus Marcellinus, in his description of Constantine&#8217;s
triumphal entrance into Rome, when he has
brought him, with no ordinary admiration, by the
Baths, the Pantheon, the Capitol, and other noble
structures, as soon as ever he gives him a sight of the
Forum of Trajan, he puts him into an ecstacy, and
cannot forbear making a harangue upon the matter.
We meet in the same place with a very smart repartee,
which Constantine received at the time from
Ormisdas, a Persian prince. The emperor, as he
greatly admired everything belonging to this noble
pile, so he had a particular fancy for the statue
of Trajan&#8217;s horse, which stood on the top of it,
and expressed his desire of doing as much for
his own beast. &#8220;Pray, sir,&#8221; says the prince, &#8220;before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
you talk of getting such a horse, will you be pleased
to build such a stable to put him in?&#8221;</p>

<p>Besides these there was another. This was situated
not in the city, but in its neighbourhood. It
was called the Forum Populi, which is frequently
mentioned in the history of the republic; and which
interests us as being the popular and commercial
resort of a free people. At stated periods, the Romans,
and their friends and allies, used to meet at
that spot, and celebrate the Latinæ Feriæ; on which
many holidays and religious ceremonies were accompanied
by renewals of treaties of amity, by the interchange
of commodities, and by manly sports and
pastimes. While the Roman citizens came from
the Tiber, the free confederates descended from their
mountains, or wended their way from the fertile
plains beyond the river. Sir William Gell thinks
he can fix this interesting spot. The habitations
around the temple of Jupiter Latialis, on Mont
Albano, are supposed to have constituted the village
called Forum Populi. It is probable that the
meeting of the Latin confederates upon the mountain,
and the fair held there, led to its erection. Here
the consuls had a house where they sometimes
lodged, which Dio Cassius (lib. iii.) says was struck
with lightning.</p>

<p>We now return to the Great Forum.</p>

<div class="poem">

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>The Forum<a name="FNanchor_152_161" id="FNanchor_152_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_161" class="fnanchor">152</a> was an entirely open space; it had
public buildings in it, as well as around it; we even
read of streets passing through it. The Curia, or
Senate-house, stood near the foot of the Palatine
hill, in about the middle of the eastern side of the
Forum. It was built originally by Tullus Hostilius,
the third king of Rome; and, after having been repaired
by Sylla, was destroyed by fire in the year
53 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span>, when the body of Clodius, who had been
murdered by Milo, was carried into it by a tumultuous
multitude, and there burnt on a funeral pile,
formed of benches of the senators, the tables, the
archives, and such other materials as the place
afforded. Sylla&#8217;s son rebuilt it; but under the
false pretence of erecting a temple to &#8220;Felicity.&#8221;
It was again restored by Julius Cæsar.</p>

<p>Vitruvius says, that the Greek Forum was square,
with ambulatories in the upper story; the Roman
was oblong, with porticos, and shops for bankers,
and with galleries in the upper floor, adapted for the
management of the public revenues. The Roman
forum also included many other edifices of a different
nature; as the basilicæ, prison, curiæ, and were
enriched with colonnades and sculpture. That of
Trajan was entered by four triumphal arches, and
had his magnificent column in the centre of it.</p>

<p>A few words will describe the present state of this
celebrated spot:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now all is changed! and here, as in the wild,</span>
<span class="i0">The day is silent, dreary as the night;</span>
<span class="i0">None stirring, save the herdsman and his herd,</span>
<span class="i0">Savage alike; or they that would explore,</span>
<span class="i0">Discuss and learnedly; or they that come</span>
<span class="i0">(And there are many who have crossed the earth)</span>
<span class="i0">That they may give the hours to meditation,</span>
<span class="i0">And wander, often saying to themselves,</span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;This was the Roman Forum.&#8221;</span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>The list of edifices in the Forum would be tedious;
nor could even learned antiquaries now make it
correct; but among them we may mention the
temple of the Penates, or household gods, the temple
of Concord, the temple of Jupiter Stator, the temple
of Castor and Pollux<a name="FNanchor_153_162" id="FNanchor_153_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_162" class="fnanchor">153</a>, the temple of Vesta, the
temple of Victory, the temple of Julius Cæsar, and
the arches of Fabian, Tiberius, and Severus. All
these, however, and in most cases even the traces of
them, have disappeared,&mdash;the few objects remaining
being a puzzle to such persons as take an interest in
them, and examine the matters on the spot.</p>

<p>&#8220;The glories of the Forum are now fled forever,&#8221;
says Mr. Eustace. Its temples are fallen; its sanctuaries
are crumbled into dust; its colonnades encumber
pavements, now buried under their remains. The
walls of the rostra, stripped of their ornaments, and
doomed to eternal silence; a few shattered porticos,
and here and there an insulated column standing in
the midst of broken shafts, vast fragments of marble
capitals and cornices heaped together in masses,
remind the traveller that the field which he now
traverses was once the Roman forum<a name="FNanchor_154_163" id="FNanchor_154_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_163" class="fnanchor">154</a>. It is reduced,
indeed, not to the pasture-ground for cattle, which
Virgil has described, but to the market-place for
pigs, sheep, and oxen; being now the Smithfield of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
Rome. The hills, the rivers, the roads and bridges,
in this mother of cities, mostly go by their ancient
Latin names, slightly altered in Italian, but the
Forum has not even retained its name; it is now
called Campo Vaccino, or the Field of Cows!</p>

<p>This scene<a name="FNanchor_155_164" id="FNanchor_155_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_164" class="fnanchor">155</a>, though now so desolate and degraded,
was once the great centre of all the business, power,
and splendour of Rome. Here, as long as the
Romans were a free people, all the affairs of the
state were debated in the most public manner; and
from the rostra, elevated in the midst of the square,
and with their eyes fixed on the capitol, which
immediately faced them, and which was suited to
fill their minds with patriotism, whilst the Tarpeian
rock reminded them of the fate reserved for
treason and corruption, the noblest of orators
&#8220;wielded at will&#8221; the fierce democracy, or filled the
souls of gathered thousands with one object, one
wish, one passion&mdash;the freedom and glory of the
Roman race;&mdash;a freedom which would have been
more enduring had the glory been less.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">&#8220;Yes; in yon field below,</span>
<span class="i1">A thousand years of silenced factions sleep&mdash;</span>
<span class="i1">The Forum, where the immortal accents glow,</span>
<span class="i0">And still the eloquent air breathes, burns, of Cicero!</span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;</span>
<span class="i1">&#8220;The field of freedom, faction, fame, and blood.</span>
<span class="i1">Here a proud people&#8217;s passions were exhaled,</span>
<span class="i1">From the first hour of empire in the bud,</span>
<span class="i1">To that when further worlds to conquer fail&#8217;d;</span>
<span class="i1">But long before had Freedom&#8217;s face been veil&#8217;d,</span>
<span class="i1">And Anarchy assumed her attributes;</span>
<span class="i1">Till every lawless soldier who assail&#8217;d</span>
<span class="i1">Trod on the trembling senate&#8217;s slavish mutes,</span>
<span class="i0">Or raised the venal voice of baser prostitutes.&#8221;</span>
</div></div>

<p>Here the orators of the people brought their accusations
against public men, or pronounced eulogies
on such as had died for their country; and here, also,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>were exhibited the bleeding heads or lifeless bodies
of traitors, or, as it but too often happened, of men
unjustly deemed so by an overbearing faction. The
Forum was the court of justice, and in homely days
of the early republic, civil and criminal causes were
tried and decided by simple laws in the open air, or
in very plain sheds built in this square. The humble
schools for the republican children (for even these
old Romans had places of public instruction for the
poor people) stood round the Forum, which seems to
have been intermixed with shops, shambles, stalls,
lowly temples, and altars.</p>

<p>No object within the walls of Rome, according to
Dr. Burton, is so melancholy as the Forum. &#8220;We
may lament,&#8221; says he, &#8220;the ruin of a temple or a
palace, but our interest in the remaining fragments
is frequently diminished by our either not knowing
with certainty to what building they belonged, or
because history has not stamped them with any
peculiar recollections. But standing upon the hill of
the Capitol, and looking down upon the Forum, we
contemplate a scene with which we fancy ourselves
familiar, and we seem suddenly to have quitted the
habitations of living men. Not only is its former
grandeur utterly annihilated, but the ground has not
been applied to any other purpose. When we
descend into it, we find that many of the ancient
buildings are buried under irregular heaps of soil.
A warm imagination might fancy that some spell
hung over the spot, forbidding it to be profaned by
the ordinary occupations of inhabited cities. What
Virgil says of its appearance before the Trojan
settlers arrived, is singularly true at the present
moment:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i04">&#8220;There oxen strolled where palaces are raised,</span>
<span class="i0">And bellowing herds in the proud Forum grazed<a name="FNanchor_156_165" id="FNanchor_156_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_165" class="fnanchor">156</a>.&#8221;</span>
</div></div>

<p>Where the Roman people saw temples erected to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>perpetuate their exploits; and where the Roman nobles
vied with each other in the magnificence of their
dwellings, we see now a few isolated pillars standing
amongst some broken arches. Or if the curiosity of
foreigners has investigated what the natives neither
think nor care about, we may, perhaps, see the remnant
of a statue, or a column, extracted from the
rubbish. Where the Comitia were held, where
Cicero harangued, and where the triumphal processions
passed, we have now no animated beings, except
strangers, attracted by curiosity; the convicts
who are employed in excavating, as a punishment,
and those more harmless animals, who find a scanty
pasture, and a shelter from the sun under a grove of
trees. If we look to the boundaries of this desolation,
the prospect is equally mournful. At one end
we have the hill of the Capitol; on the summit of
which, instead of the temple of Jupiter, the wonder
of the world, we have the palace of the solitary senator.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
If we wish to ascend this eminence, we have,
on one side, the most ancient structure in Rome, and
that a prison; on the other, the ruins of a temple,
which seems to have been amongst the finest in the
city, and the name of which is not known. If we
turn from the capital, we have, on our right, the
Palatine hill, which once contained the whole Roman
people, and which was afterwards insufficient for the
house of one emperor, and is now occupied by a few
gardens, and a convent. On the left, there is a range
of churches, formed out of ancient temples; and in
front, we discover at a considerable distance, through
the branches of trees, and the ruins of buildings, the
mouldering arches of the Colosseum.</p>

<p>The Mausoleo Adriano was erected by Adrian, in
the gardens of Domitian. It is two stories high;
the lower square, the upper round. It was formerly
covered with Parian marble, and encircled by a concentric
portico, and surmounted by a cupola. The Pons
&AElig;lius was the approach to it; during the middle ages,
it was used as a fortress; and the upper works, of brick,
were added to it by Alexander VI.; when it became
the citadel of Rome. This castle was of great service
to Pope Clement VII., when the city was surprised
(<span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 1527) by the imperial army. The castle
was formerly the burial-place of the Roman emperors,
which, after Augustus&#8217;s mausoleum on the side
of the Tiber was filled with arms, Adrian built for
himself and his successors; hence it acquired the name
of Moles Hadriani. The large round tower in the
centre of the edifice was formerly adorned with a
considerable number of small pillars and statues; but
most of them were broken to pieces by the Romans
themselves, who made use of them to defend themselves
against the Goths, when they assaulted the
city; as may be read at large in Procopius and Baronius.
On the top of it stood the Pigna, since in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
the Belvidere Gardens. It received its name of St.
Angelo, from the supposed appearance of an angel,
at the time of a pestilence, during the reign of Gregory
the Great. It was fortified by Pope Urban
VII., with five regular bastions, ramparts, moats,
&amp;c. The hall is adorned with gildings, fine paintings,
and Adrian&#8217;s statue, whose bust, with that of
Augustus, is to be seen on the castle wall.</p>

<p>The Mamertine prisons<a name="FNanchor_157_166" id="FNanchor_157_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_166" class="fnanchor">157</a> are supposed to be the
oldest monuments of antiquity in Rome. Livy speaks
of them as the work of Ancus Martius. &#8220;The state
having undergone a vast increase,&#8221; says the historian,
&#8220;and secret villanies being perpetrated, from the distinction
between right and wrong being confounded,
in so great a multitude of men, a prison was built in
the middle of the city, overhanging the Forum, as a
terror to the increasing boldness. These prisons are
supposed to be called after their founder, Martius.
They were enlarged by Servius Tullus; and the part
which he added bore the name of Tullian. The front
of this prison is open to the street; but above, and
resting on it, is built the church of San Giuseppe Falegnani.
It has an appearance of great solidity, being
composed of immense masses of stone, put together
without cement; almost every one of the blocks is
upwards of nine feet long, and in height nearly three
feet. The length of the front is forty-three feet; but
its height does not exceed seventeen; along the upper
part runs an inscription, intimating, that Caius Vibius
Rufinus and Marcus Cocceius Nerva (who were consuls
in the year 23), by a decree of the senate, repaired,
enlarged, or did something to the prison. The traveller
descends, by the aid of stairs, into the upper
cell. Nearly in the middle of the vaulted roof he
may perceive an aperture large enough to admit the
passage of a man&#8217;s body; and directly under it, in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>floor of the cell, he will see another opening of a
similar character. This affords a direct communication
with the lower prison; but he descends at another
point by a second flight of steps, modern like the
former. The second cell is of much smaller dimensions
than the other, being only nineteen feet in length,
by nine in breadth, and about six in height.&#8221; &#8220;It is
faced,&#8221; says the Rev. Mr. Burgess, &#8220;with the same
material as the upper one; and it is worthy of remark,
as a proof of its high antiquity, that the stones
are not disposed with that regularity which the
rules of good masonry require; the joinings often
coincide, or nearly so, instead of reposing over the
middle of the interior block respectively.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Burton says, &#8220;that a more horrible place for
the confinement of a human being than these prisons,
can scarcely be imagined. Their condition in ancient
times must have been still worse than it now is.
The expressions &#8216;cell of groans,&#8217; &#8216;house of sadness,&#8217;
&#8216;black prison,&#8217; &#8216;cave of darkness,&#8217; &#8216;place darkened
with perpetual night;&#8217; and many others, which are
to be met with in the pages of the later Latin writers,
sufficiently attest the character they bore in ancient
times.&#8221;</p>

<p>Quintus Pleminius, who had done good service to
the republic in the second Punic war, but who afterwards
had been sent in chains to Rome, on account
of the enormities which he had practised in the
government of the town of Locri, was incarcerated in
this prison. In the year 194 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span> certain games
were being performed in the city; and while the
minds of all were taken up with the sight of them,
Quintus Pleminius procured persons to agree to set
the city on fire, at night, in several places at once,
so that in the consternation of a nocturnal tumult,
the prison might be broken open. The matter, however,
was disclosed by persons privy thereto, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
communicated to the senate; and Pleminius was immediately
put to death in the lower cell. The accomplices
of Catiline, too, expiated their guilt in this
prison. The celebrated African king, Jugurtha, also,
in the same place closed his last days. His melancholy
end is thus described by Plutarch:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Marius, bringing back his army from Africa into
Italy, took possession of the consulship the first day
of January, and also entered Rome in triumph,
showing the Romans what they had never expected
to see; this was the king Jugurtha prisoner, who
was a man so wary, and who knew so well to accommodate
himself to fortune, and who united so much
courage to his craft and cunning, that none of his
enemies ever thought that they would have him
alive. When he had been led in the procession he
became deranged, as they say, in his understanding;
and, after the triumph, he was thrown into prison;
when, as they were stripping him of his tunic by
force, and striving in eager haste to take from him
his golden ear-ring, they tore it off, together with
the lower part of his ear. Being then thrust naked
into the deep cavern, he said, full of trouble, and
smiling bitterly, &#8216;Hercules! how cold is this bath of
yours!&#8217; Having struggled, however, for six days,
with hunger, waiting in suspense till the last hour,
from his passionate desire to live, he met with the
just rewards of his wicked deeds.&#8221; In this prison,
also, Perseus, the captive king of Macedonia, lingered
many years in hopeless misery; and in one of its
cells, also, St. Peter was imprisoned nine years.</p>

<p>Next to the Mamertine prisons, in point of antiquity,
but greatly above them as a work of labour
and art, was the <span class="smcap">Cloaca Maxima</span>. The first sewers
in Rome were constructed by Tarquinius Priscus.
The Cloaca Maxima was the work of Tarquin the
Proud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>Pliny says that Agrippa, in his ædileship, made
no less than seven streams meet together underground
in one main channel, with such a rapid current
as to carry all before them that they met with
in their passage. Sometimes when they are violently
swoln with immoderate rains, they beat with excessive
fury against the paving at the bottom and the
sides. Sometimes in a flood the Tiber waters oppose
them in their course; and then the two streams
encounter with great fury; and yet the works preserve
their ancient strength, without any sensible
damage. Sometimes huge pieces of stone and timber,
or such-like materials, are carried down the channel;
and yet the fabric receives no detriment. Sometimes
the ruin of whole buildings, destroyed by fire or other
casualties, presses heavily upon the frame. Sometimes
terrible earthquakes shake the very foundations,
and yet they still continue impregnable. Such
is the testimony of Pliny the Elder.</p>

<p>The Cloaca Maxima still exists. At its outlet in
the Tiber, it is said to be thirteen feet high, and as
many in breadth. The ancients always regarded this
work as a great wonder. Livy speaks of it in terms
of admiration; and Pliny equally so; and Dionysius
says that the sewers having been once so greatly
neglected that sufficient passage was not afforded for
the waters, it cost no less a sum than 225,000<i>l.</i> to
put them in repair.</p>

<p>The Pyramid of Cestius, one of the most ancient
remains, is the only specimen of a pyramid in Rome.
It was erected daring the republic, to the memory of
Caius Cestius, one of the priests that provided feasts
for the gods. It is of great size, being ninety-seven
feet in the base, and one hundred and twenty-four in
height; and was erected, according to the inscription,
in three hundred and thirty days.</p>

<p>This ancient monument remains entire<a name="FNanchor_158_167" id="FNanchor_158_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_167" class="fnanchor">158</a>. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>formed, externally, of white marble. At each corner on
the outside was a pillar, once surmounted with a statue.
Its form is graceful, and its appearance very picturesque;
supported on either side by the ancient wall of
Rome, with their towers and galleries venerable in decay,
half shaded by a few scattered trees; and, looking
down upon a hundred humble tents interspersed in the
neighbouring groves, it rises in lonely pomp, and seems
to preside over these fields of silence and mortality.</p>

<p>This structure was repaired by order of Pope
Alexander VII. in 1663; it having been greatly dilapidated;
no less than fifteen feet of rubbish have
accumulated above the base. &#8220;It is curious,&#8221; says
Simond, &#8220;to see how Nature, disappointed of her
usual means of destruction by the pyramidal shape,
goes to work another way. That very shape affording
a better hold for plants, their roots have penetrated
between the stones, and acting like wedges,
have lifted and thrown wide large blocks, in such a
manner, as to threaten the disjoined assemblage with
entire destruction. In Egypt, the extreme heat and
want of moisture, during a certain part of the year,
hinder the growth of plants in such situations; and
in Africa alone are pyramids eternal.&#8221;&mdash;Close to this
is the Protestant burial-ground. &#8220;When I am inclined
to be serious,&#8221; says Mr. Rogers, &#8220;I love to
wander up and down before the tomb of Caius
Cestius. The Protestant burial-ground is there; and
most of the little monuments are erected to the
young; young men of promise, cut off when on their
travels, full of enthusiasm, full of enjoyment; brides
in the bloom of their beauty, on their first journey;
or children borne from home in search of health.
This stone was placed by his fellow-travellers, young
as himself, who will return to the house of his
parents without him; that by a husband or a father,
now in his native country. His heart is buried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
in that grave. It is a quiet and sheltered nook,
covered in the winter with violets; and the pyramid
that overshadows it gives a classical and singularly
solemn air. You feel an interest there, a sympathy
you were not prepared for. You are yourself in a
foreign land; and they are for the most part your
countrymen. They call upon you in your mother
tongue&mdash;in English&mdash;in words unknown to a native;
known only to yourselves: and the tomb of Cestius,
that old majestic pile has this also in common with
them,&mdash;it is itself a stranger among strangers. It
has stood there till the language, spoken round about
it, has changed; and the shepherd, born at the foot,
can read its inscription no longer.&#8221;</p>

<span class="i1">There is a stern, round tower of other days,</span>

<p>A little beyond the Circus of Caracalla<a name="FNanchor_159_168" id="FNanchor_159_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_168" class="fnanchor">159</a> rises the
mausoleum of Cecilia Metella, a beautiful edifice,
built by Crassus, in honour of his wife. It is of
considerable height and great thickness: in the centre
is a hollow space reaching from the pavement to
the top of the building. In the concavity was deposited
the body in a marble sarcophagus, which in the
time of Paul III. was removed to the court of the
Farnesian palace. The solidity and simplicity of this
monument are worthy of the republican era in which
it was erected, and have enabled it to resist the incidents
and survive the lapse of two thousand years.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the end of the Velabrum,&#8221; says Dupaty, &#8220;I
found myself on the Appian way, and walked along
it for some time. I there found the tomb of Cecilia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
Metella, the daughter of that Crassus whose wealth
was a counterpoise to the name of Pompey and the
fortune of Cæsar. I entered the tomb, and set myself
down on the grass. The flowers which displayed
their brilliant colours in the corner of the
tomb, and as I may say amid the shades of death;
the noise of a swarm of bees who were depositing
their honey between two rows of bricks, while the
surrounding silence rendered their pleasing humming
more audible; the azure of the sky forming over my
head a magnificent dome, decorated alternately by
flying clouds of silver and of purple; the name Cecilia
Metella, who perhaps was beautiful, and possessed
of the tenderest sensibility, and who most certainly
was unfortunate; the memory of Crassus; the
image of a distracted father who strives by piling up
stones to immortalize his sorrow; the soldiers, whom
my imagination still behold combating from the
height of this tower;&mdash;all these and a thousand other
impressions gradually plunged my soul into a delicious
reverie, and it was with difficulty I could leave
the place.&#8221;</p>

<p>The portico of Octavia stood upon the Flaminian
Circus and the theatre of Marcellus; it was erected
by Augustus, in honour of his sister Octavia. This
portico formed a parallelogram, composed of a double
row of two hundred and seventy Corinthian columns
of white marble, adorned with statues, enclosing a
court, in which were two temples, dedicated to
Jupiter and Juno, a library, and a large hall for the
exhibition of paintings. A small portion of the
portico, being one of the entrances, is all that now
remains. Many of the pillars are, however, supposed
to be built up in the neighbouring houses.</p>

<p>The general use, porticoes were put to, was the
pleasure of walking or riding in them; in the shade
in summer, and in winter in the day; like the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
piazzas in Italy. Velleius Paterculus, when he deplores
the extreme corruption of manners that had
crept into Rome upon the conclusion of the Carthaginian
war, mentions particularly the vanity of the
noblemen, in endeavouring to outshine one another in
the magnificence of their porticoes, as a great instance
of their extraordinary luxury. Juvenal thus alludes
to them:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>The <i>Naumachiæ</i>, or places for the shows of sea
engagements<a name="FNanchor_160_169" id="FNanchor_160_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_169" class="fnanchor">160</a>, are nowhere particularly described;
but we may suppose them to be very little different
from the circus or amphitheatres; since those sort of
shows, for which they were designed, were often exhibited.
The <i>Naumachiæ</i> owed their original to the
time of the first Punic war, when the Romans first
initiated their men in the knowledge of sea-affairs.
After the improvement of many years, they were
designed as well for gratifying the sight, as for
increasing their naval experience and discipline; and
therefore composed one of the solemn shows by which
the magistrates or emperors, or any affecters of popularity,
so often made their court to the people.</p>

<p>The usual accounts we have of these exercises seem
to represent them as nothing else but the image of a
naval fight. But it is probable that sometimes they
did not engage in any hostile manner, but only rowed
fairly for the victory. This conjecture may be confirmed
by the authority of Virgil, who is acknowledged
by all the critics, in his descriptions of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>games and exercises to have had an eye always to
his own country, and to have drawn them after the
manner of the Roman sports. Now the sea contention,
which he presents us with, is barely a trial of
swiftness in the vessels, and of skill in managing the
oars, as is most admirably delivered in his fifth
book<a name="FNanchor_161_170" id="FNanchor_161_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_170" class="fnanchor">161</a>.</p>

<p>Warm baths were first introduced into Rome by
Mæcenas. There cannot be a greater instance of the
magnificence of the Romans than their bagnios.
Ammianus Marcellinus observes, that they were
built &#8220;in modum provinciarum,&#8221; as large as provinces;
but the great Valesius judges the word provinciarum
to be a corruption of piscinarum. And though
this emendation does in some measure extenuate one
part of the vanity which has been so often alleged
against them, from the authority of that passage of
the historian, yet the prodigious accounts we have
of their ornaments and furniture, will bring them,
perhaps, under a censure no more favourable than
the former. Seneca, speaking of the luxury of his
countrymen in this respect, complains that they were
arrived to such a pitch of niceness and delicacy, as
to scorn to set their feet on any thing but precious
stones. And Pliny wishes good old Fabricius were
but alive to see the degeneracy of his posterity, when
the very women must have their seats in the baths of
solid silver. Of the luxury and magnificence of the
Roman bath, we have an interesting account in
Seneca; we borrow the old translation, it being
somewhat of a curiosity:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of the countrie-house of Africanus, and bath:</p>

<p>&#8220;Lying in the verie towne (villa) of Scipio Africanus,
I write these things unto thee, having adored
the spirit of him and the altar, which I suppose to
be the sepulcher of so great a man. * * I saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>that towne builded of four-square stone, a wall compassing
about a wood, towers also set under both
sides of the towne for a defence. A cisterne laid
under the buildings, and green places, which was
able to serve even an armie of men. A little narrow
bathe, somewhat darke, as the olde fashion was.
None seemed warme for our ancestors except it were
obscure. Great pleasure entered into me, beholding
the manners of Scipio and of us. In this corner that
horrour of Carthage, to whom Rome is in debt that
it was taken but once, washed his bodie, wearied
with the labours of the countrie: for he exercised
himselfe in worke, and he himself tilled the earth,
as the fashion of the ancients was. He stood upon
this so base a roofe,&mdash;this so mean a floore sustained
him. But now who is he that can sustaine to be
bathed thus? Poore and base seemeth he to himself,
except the walls have shined with great and
precious rounds, except Alexandrian marbles be
distinguished with Numidian roofe-caste, except the
chamber be covered over with glasse, except stone
of the Ile Thassus, once a rare gazing-stocke in some
church (temple), have compassed about our ponds
into which we let down our bodies exhausted by
much labour; except silver cocks have poured out
water unto us. And as yet I speake of the conduits
of the common sort; what when I shall come to
the bathes of freedmen? What profusion of statues
is there; what profusion of columns holding nothing
up, but placed for ornament, merely on account of
the expense? What quantity of waters sliding downe
upon staires with a great noise? To that delicacie
are we come, that men will not tread but upon
precious stones. In this bathe of Scipio, there be
verie small chinckes, rather than windowes, cut out
in the stone wall, that without hurt of the fense
they should let the light in.  But now they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
called the bathes of moths, if any be not framed so
as to receive, with most large windows, the sunne
all the day long, except they be bathed and coloured
(sunburnt) at the same time, except from the bathing
vessel they look upon both land and sea. But in old
time there were few bathes, neither were they adorned
with any trimming up. For why should a thing of
a farthing worth be adorned, and which is invented
for use, and not for delight? Water was not poured
in, neither did it alwaies, as from a warm fountain,
runne fresh. But, O the good gods! how delightful
it was to enter into those bathes, somewhat darke
and covered with plaster of the common sort, which
thou diddest know that Cato, the overseer of the
buildings (ædile), or Fabius Maximus, or some one
of the Cornelii, had tempered for you with his own
hand! For the most noble ædiles performed this
duty also of going into those places which received
the people, and of exacting cleanliness, and an useful
and healthie temperature; not this which is
lately found out, like unto a setting on fire, so that
it is meet indeed to be washed alive, as a slave convicted
of some crime. It seemeth to me now to be
of no difference, whether the bathe be scalding hot
or be but warme. Of how great rusticity do some
now condemn Scipio, because into his warm bathe
he did not with large windowes (of transparent stone)
let in the light? O miserable man! He knew not
how to live; he was not washed in strained water,
but oftentimes in turbid, and, when more vehemently
it did rain, in almost muddy water.&#8221;</p>

<p>The more extensive and best-preserved baths now
remaining in Rome are those of Titus, Antoninus,
Caracalla, and Dioclesian. In the time of Ammianus
Marcellinus there were sixteen public baths. These
were surrounded by extensive gardens; and the main
buildings were used, some for bathing and swimming;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
some for athletic exercises; and others for
lectures, recitation, and conversation. They were
splendidly fitted up, and furnished with considerable
libraries.</p>

<p>The ruins of what are called the baths of Titus
extend to a great area. The site is, to a considerable
extent, occupied by gardens; in various parts of
which are to be seen fragments, all once belonging to
the same edifice. This building seems to have consisted
of two stories. Of the upper one little remains;
but of the lower there are more than thirty
rooms accessible.</p>

<p>&#8220;We passed,&#8221; says the author of &#8216;Rome in the
Nineteenth Century,&#8217; describing a visit to the baths,
&#8220;the mouths of nine long corridors, converging together
like the radii of the segment of a circle, divided
from each other by dead walls, covered at the top,
and closed at the end. They must always have been
dark. Having passed these corridors, we entered
the portal of what is called the house of Mæcenas.
It is known that the house and gardens of Mæcenas
stood in this part of the Esquiline-hill, which, before
it was given him by Augustus, was the charnel-ground
of the common people. The conflagration in
Nero&#8217;s reign did not reach to them; and it is believed,
that a part of them was taken by Nero into his
buildings, and by Titus into his baths. Antiquaries
think they can trace a difference in the brick-work
and style of building, between what they consider as
the erection of Augustus&#8217;s and that of Titus&#8217;s age:
and on these grounds, the parts they point out as
vestiges of the house of Mæcenas, are the entrance,
which leads into a range of square and roofless chambers
(called, on supposition, the public baths), and
the wall on the right in passing through them, which
is partially formed of reticulated building in patches.
From these real or imaginary classic remains, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
entered a damp and dark corridor, the ceiling of
which is still adorned with some of the most beautiful
specimens, that now remain, of the paintings of
antiquity. Their colouring is fast fading away, and
their very outline, I should fear, must be obliterated
at no very distant period; so extreme is the humidity
of the place, and so incessantly does the water-drop
fall. By the light of a few trembling tapers
elevated on the top of a long bending cane, we saw,
at least twenty feet above our heads, paintings in
arabesque, executed with a grace, a freedom, a correctness
of design, and a masterly command of pencil,
that awakened our highest admiration, in spite of all
the disadvantages under which they were viewed.
* * * Leaving the painted corridor, which is
adorned with these beautiful specimens of ancient
art, we entered halls, which, like it, must always
have been dark, but are still magnificent. The bright
colouring of the crimson stucco, the alcove still
adorned with gilding, and the ceilings beautifully
painted with fantastic designs, still remain in many
parts of them; but how chill, how damp, how desolate
are now these gloomy halls of imperial luxury!
No sound is to be heard through them, but that of
the slow water-drop. In one of these splendid dungeons,
we saw the remains of a bath, supposed to
have been for the private use of the emperor. In
another we were shown the crimson-painted alcove,
where the Laocöon was found in the reign of Leo
the Tenth. The French, who cleared out a great
many of these chambers, found nothing but the Pluto
and Cerberus, now in the Capitol, a work of very
indifferent sculpture.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another critic (Knight) has estimated these paintings
rather differently. &#8220;The paintings on the walls,&#8221;
says he, &#8220;consist chiefly of what we now call arabesques;
the figures are all very small, and arranged in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
patterns and borders. They consist of birds and beasts;
among which some green parrots may be seen very distinctly;
the ground is generally a rich dark red. At
the end of one of these rooms is a large painting of
some building, in which the perspective is said to be
correctly given. This seems to disprove the charge
which has been brought against the ancient painters,
of not understanding the rules of perspective; none
of these paintings can, however, be justly regarded
as specimens of ancient art; they were intended
solely as decorations to the apartments, and were
doubtless the work of ordinary house-painters. To
judge of the proficiency of the ancient painters from
such remains as these would be as unfair, to use Dr.
Burton&#8217;s remark, as to estimate the state of the arts
in England from the sign-posts. Where the walls of
the rooms are bare, the brick-work has a most singular
appearance of freshness; the stucco also is very
perfect in many parts; but the marble, of which
there are evident traces on the walls of the floors, is
gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ruins of the baths of Caracalla are so extensive,
that they occupy a surface equal to one-sixteenth of
a square mile. Next to the Coliseum, they present
the greatest mass of ancient building in Rome. &#8220;At
each end,&#8221; says Mr. Eustace, &#8220;were two temples;
one dedicated to Apollo, and the other to &AElig;sculapius,
as the tutelary deities of the place, sacred to the improvement
of the mind, and the care of the body: the
two other temples were dedicated to the two protecting
divinities of the Antonine family; Hercules
and Bacchus. In the principal building were, in
the first place, a grand circular vestibule, with four
baths on each side, for cold, tepid, warm, and sea
baths; in the centre was an immense square for
exercise, when the weather was unfavourable for
it in the open air: beyond it is a marble hall, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
sixteen hundred marble seats were placed for the
convenience of the bathers; at each end of this hall
were libraries. This building terminated on both
sides with a court, surrounded with porticoes, with
an odeum for music, and in the middle a spacious
basin for swimming. Round this edifice were walks
shaded by rows of trees, particularly the plane; and
in its front extended a gymnasium, for running,
wrestling, &amp;c., in fine weather. The whole was
surrounded by a vast portico, opening into spacious
halls, where the poets declaimed, and philosophers
gave lectures to their auditors.&#8221;</p>

<p>The following account is from the author of Rome
in the Nineteenth Century. &#8220;We passed through a
long succession of immense halls, open to the sky,
whose pavements of costly marbles, and rich mosaics,
long since torn away, have been supplied by the soft
green turf, that forms a carpet more in unison with
their deserted state. The wind sighing through the
branches of the aged trees, that have taken root in
them, without rivalling their loftiness, was the only
sound we heard; and the bird of prey, which burst
through the thick ivy of the broken wall far above
us, was the only living object we beheld. These
immense halls formed part of the internal division of
the Thermæ, which was entirely devoted to purposes
of amusement. The first of the halls, or walled
enclosures, that you enter, and several of the others,
have been open in the centre. These were surrounded
by covered porticos, supported by immense
columns of granite, which have long since been
carried away; chiefly by the popes, and princes of
the Farnese family. In consequence of their loss the
roofs fell with a concussion so tremendous, that it is
said to have been felt even in Rome, like the distant
shock of an earthquake. Fragments of this vaulted
roof are still lying at the corners of the porticoes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
The open part, in the centre, was probably designed
for athletic sports. Many have been the doubts and
disputes among the antiquaries, which of these halls
have the best claims to be considered as the once
wonderful Cella Solearis. All are roofless now;
but the most eastern of them, that which is farthest
to the left on entering, and which evidently had
windows, seems generally to enjoy the reputation.
Besides these enormous halls, there are, on the
western side of these ruins, the remains of a large
circular building, and a great number of small divisions,
of all sizes and forms, in their purpose wholly
incomprehensible; except that they belonged to that
part of the Thermæ destined for purposes of amusement.
Nothing can now be known; and though
the immense extent of the baths may be traced,
far from hence, by the wide-spreading ruins, it is
equally difficult and unprofitable to explore them
any further.&#8221;</p>

<p>In these baths were discovered (<span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 1540), the
celebrated Farnese Hercules; also the famous Flora
(1540); and the Farnese Bull, in 1544. In those
of Titus, the Belvidere Meleager; and the wonderful
group, entitled the Laocöon; and not far from them
the exquisite figure of Antinous.</p>

<p>Columns, or pillars,<a name="FNanchor_162_171" id="FNanchor_162_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_171" class="fnanchor">162</a> were none of the meanest
beauties of the city. They were at least converted
to the same design as the arches; for the honourable
memorial of some noble victory or exploit; after
they had been a long time in use for the chief ornament
of the sepulchres of great men.</p>

<p>There are three columns more celebrated than the
rest. These are, the pillars of Trajan, of Antoninus,
and of Phocas. The first of these was set up in
the middle of Trajan&#8217;s Forum; being composed of
twenty-four great stones of marble;<a name="FNanchor_163_172" id="FNanchor_163_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_172" class="fnanchor">163</a> but so curiously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>cemented, as to seem one entire natural stone. The
height was one hundred and forty-four feet, according
to Eutropius; though Marlian seems to make
them but one hundred and twenty-eight: yet they
are easily reconciled, if we suppose one of them to
have begun the measure from the pillar itself, and
the other from the basis. It is ascertained on the
inside by one hundred and eighty-five winding stairs,
and has forty little windows for the admission of
light. The noblest ornament of this pillar was the
statue of Trajan at the top, of a gigantic height;
being no less than twenty-five feet high. He was
represented in a coat of armour, proper to the general,
holding in his left hand a sceptre; in his right
a hollow globe of gold, in which his ashes were deposited
after his death.</p>

<p>The subjects of the bas-reliefs, as we have already
stated, are the victories of Trajan, in his Dacian
campaign<a name="FNanchor_164_173" id="FNanchor_164_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_173" class="fnanchor">164</a>. The whole number of figures sculptured
is about 2,500; and the figure of Trajan himself is
repeated more than fifty times. At the lower part
of the column, the human figures are about two feet
high; as they ascend, and thus become further removed
from the eye, their size is increased, till, at the
top of the column, they have nearly double the height
that they have below. These bas-reliefs are executed
with great delicacy and spirit; but they possess a
higher value of a different kind. &#8220;The Roman dress
and manners,&#8221; says Dr. Burton, &#8220;may receive a considerable
light from them. We find the soldiers constantly
carrying their swords on the right side. On
a march they are generally bare-headed; some have
no helmets at all; others wear them suspended to
their right shoulder; each of them carries a stick over
the left shoulder, which seems to have been for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>purpose of carrying their provisions. We may observe
also a wallet, a vessel for wine, and a machine
for dressing meat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Their shields<a name="FNanchor_165_174" id="FNanchor_165_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_174" class="fnanchor">165</a> were oblong, with different devices
upon them; their standards of various kinds; pictures
also were used; which were portraits of gods,
or heroes. The soldiers wear upon their legs a kind
of light pantaloons, reaching a little below the knee,
and not buttoned. The Dacians have loose pantaloons,
reaching to the ankle, and shoes; they also
carry curved swords. The Sarmatian cavalry, allies
of Decabalus (the Dacian king) wear plated armour,
covering the men and horses. Their armour
was a covering of thin circular plates, which were
adapted to the movements of the body, and drawn
over all their limbs; so that in whatever direction
they wished to move, their clothing allowed them
free play, by the close fitting of its joints. Some
Roman soldiers have also plate-armour; but they
are archers. The horses have saddles, or rather
cloths, which are fastened by cords round the breast,
and under the tail. The Dacian horses are without
this covering; and the Germans, or some other allies,
have neither saddles nor bridles to their horses. We
might observe several other particulars, such as a
bridge of boats over a river, and that the boats everywhere
are without a rudder, but are guided by an
oar, fastened with a thong on one side of the stern.
The wall of the camp has battlements, and the heads
of the Dacians are stuck to it. The Dacian women
are represented burning the Roman prisoners. We
may also see the testudo, formed by soldiers putting
their shields together in a compact mass over their
backs. Victory is represented as writing with a
pen on a shield<a name="FNanchor_166_175" id="FNanchor_166_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_175" class="fnanchor">166</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>The column of Antoninus was raised in imitation
of this, which it exceeded in one respect; that it was
one hundred and seventy-six feet high. The work
was much inferior to that of Trajan&#8217;s, as being undertaken
in the declining age of the empire. The ascent
on the inside was by one hundred and six stairs, and
the windows in the sides fifty-six. The sculpture
and the other monuments were of the same nature
as those of the first; and on the top stood a colossus
of the emperor, naked, as appears from some of his
coins. Both these columns are still standing; the
former most entire. But Pope Sixtus V., instead of
the statues of the emperors, set up St. Peter&#8217;s, on the
column of Trajan, and St. Paul&#8217;s, on that of Antoninus.</p>

<p>The historical columns<a name="FNanchor_167_176" id="FNanchor_167_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_176" class="fnanchor">167</a> are true to no order of
architecture. Trajan&#8217;s has a Tuscan base and capital,
and a pedestal with Corinthian mouldings. That
of M. Aurelius repeats the same mixture; but its
pedestal is restored: and though higher, both in
proportion and in place, than Trajan&#8217;s, does not
associate so well with its shaft. These are the only
regular pedestals that are observed in Roman antiquity.</p>

<p>Next to these may be classed the column of
Phocas<a name="FNanchor_168_177" id="FNanchor_168_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_177" class="fnanchor">168</a>. So recently as twenty-four years ago, the
whole of its base, and part of the shaft, were buried
in the soil; and up to that time, the ingenuity of
the learned was severely tried, in the attempt to find
for it a name. One thought it a fragment of the
Græcostasis; another adjudged it to a temple of
Jupiter Custos; and a third urged the claim of Caligula&#8217;s
bridge. At length, it was thought that, possibly,
the column might originally have been isolated,
and thus in itself a complete monument; that, consequently,
if the earth at its foot were removed, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>pedestal might be uncovered with some inscriptions
thereon. The Duchess of Devonshire had recourse
to this simple expedient, in the year 1813; the base
of the column was laid open, and upon it an inscription
was found, recording the fact, that a gilt statue
was placed on the top of it in the year 608, in honour
of the emperor Phocas, by Smaragdus, exarch of
Italy.</p>

<p>The material of the column is Greek marble, the
capital is Corinthian, and the shaft is fluted. The
height is forty-six feet, but as it stands upon a
pyramid of eleven steps, its elevation is increased
about eleven feet.</p>

<p>The seventh Basilica stands about two miles from
the walls; the church itself is a fine building, restored
in 1611; but the portico, of antique marble
columns, is of the time of Constantine. Under the
church are the openings to very extensive catacombs,
originally formed no doubt by the ancient Romans,
to procure pozzolana for their buildings; and enlarged
by the early Christians, who used them as places of
refuge during their persecutions, and as <i>cemeteries</i>,
one hundred and seventy thousand of them having,
it is said, been interred there. The passages are
from two to three feet in width, and extend several
miles in different directions.</p>

<p>A hall of immense size<a name="FNanchor_169_178" id="FNanchor_169_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_178" class="fnanchor">169</a> was discovered about the
beginning of the last century, concealed under the
ruins of its own massive roof. The pillars of <i>verde
antico</i> that supported its vaults, the statues that
ornamented its niches, and the rich marbles that
formed its pavements, were found buried in rubbish,
and were immediately carried away by the Farnesian
family, the proprietors of the soil, to adorn their
palaces and furnish their galleries. This hall is now
cleared of its encumbrances, and presents to the eye
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>a vast length of naked wall, and an area covered with
weeds. &#8220;As we stood contemplating its extent and
proportion,&#8221; continues Mr. Eustace, &#8220;a fox started
from an aperture, once a window, at one end, and
crossing the open space, scrambled up the ruins at the
other, and disappeared in the rubbish. This scene
of desolation reminded me of Ossian&#8217;s beautiful
description:&mdash;&#8216;The thistle shook there its lonely
head; the moss whistled to the gale; the fox looked
out from the windows; the rank grass waved round
his head.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>There are twelve obelisks at Rome still standing
erect, the oldest of which is that brought by Augustus,
which is eighty feet in height, decorating the fine
square called Piazza del Popolo.</p>

<p>Roman conquerors had successively enriched the
capital of the world with the monuments of subdued
nations, and with the spirit of art from Sicily,
Greece, and Egypt. Among these, the emperor
Augustus ordered two Egyptian obelisks to be carried
to Rome. To this end, an immense vessel of a
peculiar structure was built, and when, after a
tedious and difficult voyage, it reached the Tiber
with its freight, one of the columns was placed in the
Grand Circus, and the other in the Campus Martius.
Caligula adorned Rome with a third Egyptian
obelisk, obtained in the like manner.</p>

<p>A fourth was added afterwards. The emperor
Constantine, equally ambitious of these costly foreign
ornaments, resolved to decorate his newly-founded
capital of Constantinople with the largest of all the
obelisks that stood on the ruins of Thebes. He
succeeded in having it conveyed as far as Alexandria,
but, dying at the time, its destination was changed,
and an enormous raft, managed by three hundred
rowers, transported the granite obelisk from Alexandria
to Rome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>The Circi were places set apart for the celebration
of several sorts of games. They were generally
oblong, or almost in the shape of a bow, having a
wall quite round, with ranges of seats for the convenience
of the spectators. At the entrance of the
circus stood the Carceres, or lists, whence they
started, and just by them one of the Metæ, or
marks, the other standing at the further end to
conclude the race. &#8220;There were several of these
Circi at Rome, as those of Flaminius, Nero, Caracalla,
and Severus; but the most remarkable, as the
very name imports, was Circus Maximus, first built
by Tarquinius Priscus. The length of it was four
furlongs, the breadth the like number of acres, with
a trench of ten feet deep, and as many broad, to
receive the water; and seats enough for one hundred
and fifty thousand men. It was beautified and
adorned by succeeding princes, particularly by Julius
Cæsar, Augustus, Caligula, Domitian, Trajan, and
Heliogabalus; and enlarged to such a prodigious
extent as to be able to contain, in their proper seats,
two hundred and sixty thousand spectators. In the
time of Constantine it would hold three hundred and
eighty-five thousand persons to view the combats,
chariot races, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_170_179" id="FNanchor_170_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_179" class="fnanchor">170</a>&#8221; The Circus Maximus stands on
the spot where the games were celebrated when the
Romans seized the Sabine women; and it was here
also that the interesting scene took place between
Androcles and the lion.</p>

<p>The number of beasts exhibited in the circus is
wonderful; and were it not well attested, would
be incredible. In the days of imperial splendour,
nearly every rare animal that Western Asia or
Northern Africa could produce, was commonly exhibited
to the Roman people. In the year 252 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span>
one hundred and forty-two elephants, brought from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
Sicily, were exhibited in the circus. Cæsar, in his
third dictatorship, showed a vast number of wild
beasts, among which were four hundred lions, and a
camelopard. The emperor Gordian devised a novel
kind of spectacle; he converted the Circus into a
temporary kind of wood, and turned into it two
hundred stags, thirty wild horses, one hundred wild
sheep, ten elks, one hundred Cyprian bulls, three
hundred ostriches, thirty wild asses, one hundred
and fifty wild boars, two hundred ibices, and two
hundred deer. He then allowed the people to enter
the wood, and to take what they pleased. Forty
years afterwards the emperor Probus<a name="FNanchor_171_180" id="FNanchor_171_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_180" class="fnanchor">171</a> imitated his
example. &#8220;Large trees were pulled up by the
roots,&#8221; says an ancient writer, &#8220;and fastened to
beams, which were laid down crossing each other.
Soil was then thrown upon them, and the whole
Circus planted like a wood. One thousand ostriches,
one thousand stags, one thousand ibices, wild sheep,
and other grazing animals, as many as could be fed
or found, were turned in, and the people admitted as
before.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of the trouble which was taken in the republican
times to procure rare animals for exhibition in Rome,
we have a curious illustration in the letters of Cicero.
The orator went out in the year 52 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span>, as governor
of a province of Asia Minor; and while there,
he was thus addressed by his friend C&#339;lius:&mdash;&#8220;I
have spoken to you, in almost all my letters,
about the panthers. It will be disgraceful to you,
that Patiscus has sent ten panthers to Curio, while
you have scarcely sent a greater number to me.
Curio has made me a present of these, and ten
others from Africa. If you will only keep it in
mind, and employ the people of Cybira, and also
send letters into Pamphylia (for I understand that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>the greatest number are taken there), you will gain
your object.&#8221; To this the proconsul replies:&mdash;&#8220;I
have given particular orders about the panthers
to those who are in the habit of hunting them; but
they are surprisingly scarce; and it is said, that
those which are there, make a great complaint that
there are no snares laid against any one in my province
but themselves. It is accordingly supposed,
that they are determined to quit my province. I
go into Caria. However, I shall use all diligence.&#8221;</p>

<p>The avidity<a name="FNanchor_172_181" id="FNanchor_172_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_181" class="fnanchor">172</a> with which the amusements of the
Circus were sought, increased with the decline of the
empire and the corruption of morals. Ammianus
Marcellinus, who wrote in the fourth century of the
Christian era, gives us the following description:&mdash;&#8220;The
people spend all their evenings in drinking and
gaming, in spectacles, amusements, and shows. The
Circus Maximus is their temple, their dwelling-house,
their public meeting, and all their hopes. In
the Forum, the streets, and squares, multitudes assemble
together, and dispute, some defending one
thing, and some another. The oldest take the privilege
of age, and cry out in the temples and Forum,
that the republic must fall, if in the approaching
games the person whom they support does not win
the prize and first pass the goal. When the wished-for
day of the equestrian games arrives, before sunrise
all run headlong to the spot, passing in swiftness
the chariots that are to run; upon the success of
which their wishes are so divided, that many pass
the night without sleep.&#8221; Lactantius confirms this
account, and says that the people, from their great
eagerness, often quarrelled and fought.</p>

<p>Fortunately there still exists, about two miles
from the walls of Rome, an ancient circus in a high
state of preservation; and from this we are enabled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>to acquire a very good notion of the form and
arrangement of such structures. The chief entrance
was an opening at the straight end; and on each side
of it were six carceres, or starting-places. At the
rounded end, or that opposite to the carceres, was
the Porta Triumphalis, or Triumphal Gate, by
which the victor left the circus; the rest of the enclosed
space were the seats for the spectators, raised
in rows one above the other. Down the middle of
the area, or more properly speaking, rather nearer
to one side than the other, ran a raised division,&mdash;a
sort of thick dwarf wall, called the Spina; equal
in length to about two-thirds of the area itself. At
each end of this spina was a small meta, or goal,
formed of three cones. The meta which approached
the triumphal gate was much nearer to it than the
other meta was to the carceres. The course which
the chariots ran was by the side of the spina, and
round the metæ. All these different parts of the
circus were variously ornamented; the spina especially
was highly decorated, having sometimes in the
middle one of those lofty Egyptian obelisks, of which
there are more to be seen at this day in Rome, than
are assembled anywhere else<a name="FNanchor_173_182" id="FNanchor_173_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_182" class="fnanchor">173</a>.</p>

<p>Besides the Mamertine prisons and the Cloaca Maxima,
there are other antiquities at Rome which belong
to the early period. Among these are the foundations
and great fragments of the ancient buildings of
the <span class="smcap">Capitol</span>. The Capitol-hill is said to form a link
between the ancient city and the modern one.&mdash;&#8220;From
an elevated station, about two hundred and
fifty feet above the Forum,&#8221; says Simond, &#8220;the voice
of Cicero might have been heard, revealing to the
people, assembled before the Temple of Concord, (to
which the ruins nearest to us probably belonged,)
Catiline&#8217;s conspiracy. He might even have been heard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>in the Tribune of Harangues, situated on the other
side of the Forum, and next to the Temple of Jupiter
Stator,&mdash;of which there are three columns still standing,&mdash;taking
the oath <i>that he had saved his country</i>,
and all the people taking the same oath after him.
But the gory head and hand of this saviour of his
country might have been seen from our station soon
after, nailed to the side of this same tribune, and the
same people tamely looking on! Instead of the contending
crowds of patriots, conspirators, orators, heroes,
and fools, each acting his part, we now saw only
a few cows quietly picking up blades of grass among
the ruins; beggars, and monks, and asses loaded with
bags of puzzolana, and a gang of galley-slaves lazily
digging away for antiquities, under the lash of their
taskmasters.&#8221;</p>

<p>The hill of the Capitol derived its name from the
head of Tolus<a name="FNanchor_174_183" id="FNanchor_174_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_183" class="fnanchor">174</a>, and the prediction of universal empire
to those who held it. It was famous for a temple
of Jupiter Capitolinus, which was the effect of a
vow made by Tarquinius Priscus in the Sabine war.
But he had scarcely laid the foundations before his
death. His nephew, Tarquinius the Proud, finished
it with the spoils taken from the neighbouring nations.
But upon the expulsion of the kings, the
consecration was performed by Horatius the consul.
The structure stood on a high ridge, taking in four
acres of ground. The front was adorned with three
rows of pillars, the other side with two. Its ascent
from the ground was by one hundred steps. The prodigious
gifts and ornaments, with which it was several
times endowed, almost exceed belief. Suetonius tells
us that Augustus gave at one time two thousand
pounds weight of gold; and a precious stone to the
value of five hundred sestertia. Livy and Pliny
surprise us with accounts of the brazen thresholds, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>noble pillars, that Sylla removed hither from
Athens out of the temple of Jupiter Olympius; the
gilded roof, the gilded shields, and those of solid silver;
the huge vessels of silver, holding three measures;
the golden chariot, &amp;c. This temple was
first consumed by fire in the Marian war, and then
rebuilt by Sylla, who, dying before the dedication,
left that honour to Quintus Catulus. This too was
demolished in the Vitellian sedition. Vespasian undertook
a third, which was burnt down about the
time of his death. Domitian raised the last and most
glorious of all; in which the very gilding amounted
to twelve thousand talents (£2,250,000). He
adorned it with some columns of Pentelic marble
brought from Athens. Indeed, his extravagance in
this and other public works led to that exceeding
severity which accompanied the exaction of the capitation
tax from the Jewish people. It was the opinion
of contemporaries of the emperor, that if he
were to reclaim from the gods the sums which he
now expended upon them, even Jupiter himself,
though he were to hold a general auction in Olympus,
would be unable to pay a twelfth of his debts, or, as we
should say, one shilling and eightpence in the pound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>Of all the ancient glory of the Capitol,<a name="FNanchor_175_184" id="FNanchor_175_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_184" class="fnanchor">175</a> nothing
now remains but the solid foundation and vast substructions
raised on the rock. Not only is the
Capitol fallen, but its very name, expressive of dominion,
and once fondly considered as an omen of
empire, is now almost lost in the semi-barbarous
appellation of Campi-doglio. &#8220;This place,&#8221; says a
celebrated French traveller, &#8220;which gave law to
the universe, where Jupiter had his temple and
Rome her senate; from whence of old the Roman
eagles were continually flying into every quarter of
the globe, and from every quarter of the globe continually
winging their way back with victories;
whence a single word from the mouth of Scipio, of
Pompey, or of Cæsar, quickly reached the most distant
nations, menacing their liberty, and deciding on
the fate of kings; where the greatest men of the republic,
in short, still continued to live after their
death in statues, and still to govern the world with
the authority of Romans: this place so renowned has
lost its statues, its senate, its citadel, its temples; it
has retained nothing but its name, so cemented by
the blood and tears of nations, that time has not yet
been able to disjoin the immortal syllables of which
it is composed. It is still called the Capitol. At
the Capitol we perceive, in the strongest light, the
insignificance of all human things, and the power
of fortune.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Pantheon is the most perfect of all the remains
of ancient Rome, and the only one of the Pagan temples
that retains any thing of its original appearance.
It was dedicated<a name="FNanchor_176_185" id="FNanchor_176_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_185" class="fnanchor">176</a> either to Jupiter Ultor, or to Mars
and Venus, or, more probably, to all the gods in
general. The structure, according to Fabricius, is
one hundred and forty feet high, and about the same
in breadth; but a later author has increased the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>number to one hundred and fifty-eight. The roof
is curiously vaulted, void places being left here and
there for the greater strength.</p>

<p>The statues of all the gods were in this temple;
and these, according to their degrees, were of gold,
silver, bronze, or marble. The portico is one hundred
and ten feet long<a name="FNanchor_177_186" id="FNanchor_177_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_186" class="fnanchor">177</a>, by forty-four in depth, and is
supported by sixteen columns of the Corinthian order.
Each of the shafts of these columns is of one piece of
oriental granite, and forty-two feet in height; the
bases and capitals are of white marble. The whole
height of the columns is forty-six feet five inches;
the diameter, just above the base, is four feet ten
inches; and, just beneath the capital, four feet three
inches. The interior of the rotunda has a diameter
of nearly one hundred and fifty feet.</p>

<p>This building has been generally attributed wholly
to Agrippa; but from careful research, Desgodetz
asserts that the body of the edifice is of much earlier
origin; and that Agrippa only newly modelled and
embellished the inside, and added the magnificent
portico. The building is circular, with a noble dome,
and a fine portico of sixteen pillars of oriental granite.
There are no windows, the light being admitted by a
circular aperture in the dome. The fine marble with
which the walls were encrusted, and the brass which
covered the roof, have long since disappeared; the
bare bricks alone are left.</p>

<p>As St. Peter&#8217;s affords the best sample of modern
art in Rome<a name="FNanchor_178_187" id="FNanchor_178_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_187" class="fnanchor">178</a>, so does the Pantheon exhibit the most
satisfactory and best-preserved specimen of ancient
art; for, notwithstanding the injuries it has sustained
by the hands of barbarians of all ages, no signs of
natural decay are yet visible; and with this magnificent
model before their eyes, it appears strange, that
the architects of St. Peter&#8217;s should not have accomplished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
their task more worthily. The Pantheon
seems to be the hemispherical summit of a modern
temple, taken off and placed on the ground; so it
appears to us, at least, accustomed to see cupolas in
the former situation only.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is built in the dirtiest part of modern Rome,&#8221;
says the author of Rome in the Nineteenth Century;
&#8220;and the unfortunate spectator, who comes with a
mind filled with enthusiasm, to gaze upon this monument
of the taste and magnificence of antiquity, finds
himself surrounded by all that is most revolting to
the senses, distracted by incessant uproar, pestered
by the crowd of clamorous beggars, and stuck fast in
the congregated filth of every description that covers
the slippery pavement; so that the time he forces
himself to spend in admiring its noble portico, generally
proves a penance from which he is glad to be
liberated, instead of an enjoyment he wishes to protract.
We escaped none of these nuisances, except
the mud, by sitting in an open carriage to survey it.
The smells of the beggars were equally annoying.
You may perhaps form some idea of the situation
of the Pantheon at Rome, by imagining what
Westminster Abbey would be in Covent Garden
Market.&#8221;</p>

<p>This does not appear, however, to have damped the
enthusiasm of Dupaty:&mdash;&#8220;I first directed my steps,&#8221;
says he, &#8220;towards the Pantheon, dedicated by
Agrippa to all the gods, and since, I know not by
what pope, to all the saints<a name="FNanchor_179_188" id="FNanchor_179_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_188" class="fnanchor">179</a>. This consecration has
preserved the Pantheon from the general pillage and
destruction which the other temples have undergone.
It has been despoiled of every thing that made it
rich; but they have left all that made it great. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>has lost its marbles, its porphyry, its alabaster,
but it has preserved its dome, its peristyle, and
its columns. How magnificent is this peristyle!
The eyes are just attracted by eight Corinthian
columns, on which rests the pediment of this immortal
monument. These columns are beautiful from the
harmony of the most perfect workmanship, and the
lapse of twenty centuries, which adds to their grandeur,
and the awe they inspire. The eye can never
tire with mounting with them in the air, and following
their descent. They present I know not what
appearance of animated life, that creates a pleasing
illusion, an elegant shape, a noble stature, and a
majestic head, round which the acanthus, with leaves
at once so flexible and so superb, forms a crown;
which, like that of kings, serves the double purpose
of decorating the august head to which it gives a
splendour, and disguising the immense weight that
loads it. How richly does architecture, which
creates such monuments, merit a place among the fine
arts!&#8221;</p>

<p>The light, as we have before observed, is admitted
only by a circular opening in the dome, which is
twenty-eight feet in diameter<a name="FNanchor_180_189" id="FNanchor_180_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_189" class="fnanchor">180</a>. Through this aperture
a flood of light diffuses itself over the whole
edifice, producing a sublime effect, but only showing
all its beauties by permitting every passing shower to
deluge its gorgeous pavement. The rain is carried
off by a drain to the Tiber; but from the low situation
of the building in the Campus Martius, the
waters of the Tiber, when it is swollen, find their
way up the drain, and flood the interior. Myriads
of beetles, scorpions, worms, rats and mice, may then
be seen retreating before the waters, as they gradually
rise from the circumference to the centre of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>the area, which is a little elevated above the rest of
it. &#8220;A beautiful effect,&#8221; says Dr. Burton, &#8220;is produced
by visiting the building on these occasions at
night, when the moon is reflected upon the water,
through the aperture of the dome.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Pantheon retains its majestic portico,&#8221; says
Mr. Eustace, &#8220;and presents its graceful dome uninjured;
the pavement, laid by Agrippa, and trodden
by Augustus, still forms its floor; the compartments
and fluted pillars of the richest marble, that originally
lined its walls, still adorn its inward circumference;
the deep tints that age has thrown over it,
only contribute to raise its dignity, and augment
our veneration; and the traveller enters its portal,
through which twice twenty generations have flowed
in succession, with a mixture of awe and religious
veneration. Yet the Pantheon itself has been &#8216;shorn
of its beams,&#8217; and looks eclipsed through the &#8216;disastrous
twilight of eighteen centuries.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Augustus dwelt at first<a name="FNanchor_181_190" id="FNanchor_181_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_190" class="fnanchor">181</a> near the Roman Forum,
in a house which had belonged to the orator Calvus;
afterwards on the Palatine, but in the moderate house
of Hortensius, which was not conspicuous, either for
extent or ornament; it had some porticoes of Alban
columns, and rooms without any marble or remarkable
pavement. For more than forty years he occupied
the same chamber, in winter and in summer;
and although he found the city by no means favourable
to his health in the winter, yet he constantly
passed the winter in it. After the palace had been
accidentally destroyed by fire, Augustus had it rebuilt,
as we are told, and ordered it to be entirely
opened to the public. This edifice was called Palatium,
from the name of the hill on which it stood;
and that being afterwards applied to the residence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>of the Roman emperors, it has passed into most of
the languages of Europe, as the common appellation
of a princely mansion.</p>

<p>It was under the immediate successors of Augustus
that the Palatine rose in splendour, till it eclipsed
all that we read of magnificence in the history of the
ancient world. The imperial possessors of this proud
eminence seem to have regarded it as a theatre for
their amusement; and upon it their &#8220;gorgeous tyranny&#8221;
was amply displayed, in the vast and costly
structures which they erected for the gratification of
their personal pleasure or caprice.</p>

<p>This palace received many additions by Tiberius,
Caligula, and Domitian; and, finally, by Nero; from
whom it was called &#8220;the golden house of Nero.&#8221;
It is thus described by Salmon, from Suetonius, Tacitus,
and other writers:&mdash;&#8220;From the remains in the
back part of the Palatine-hill, the ancient palace of
Nero, from its great extent and vast size, was no less
difficult to be inhabited than it is for us to believe
its magnificence. It was built by the famous architects
Severus and Cererus. In the vestibule or principal
entrance was the colossal statue of Nero, of
bronze. It was one hundred and twenty feet high,
of excellent workmanship, by Zenodorus, who was
sent for from Gaul for the purpose. It was restored
by Vespasian, and dedicated to the sun. The emperor
added the rays, which were twenty-two feet
and a half in length. In the porticos were three
galleries supported by large columns, which extended
a mile in length. This palace enclosed all the Palatine-hill,
together with the plain between the Palatine
and the Cælius, and part of the Esquiline mount
near to the garden of Mæcenas. It was raised on
large columns of marble carried on a level from the
Palatine to the Esquiline. The superb entrance was
facing the Via Sacra. Nero, in order to execute this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
design, destroyed the houses of many of the citizens,
which occasioned the saying, that Rome consisted of
one house. Tacitus writes, that when Rome was in
flames seven days and nights, it was not to be extinguished
till all the buildings about the Palatine
were burnt. Where the amphitheatre now stands,
Nero formed a lake to resemble the sea, with edifices
around it similar to a city, together with extensive
gardens and walks, and places for wild beasts, vineyards,
&amp;c. In the palace were a great number of
halls, and an innumerable quantity of rooms, galleries,
and statues, resplendent in every part with gold,
gems, and precious stones; from which circumstance
it acquired the name of the golden house. Many
of the rooms destined for public feasts were very
spacious, with most beautiful ceilings, which turned
round in such a manner that from various parts there
fell flowers and exquisite odours. The principal hall
where Nero supped was circular, and of such art,
that the ceiling was ornamented with stars to resemble
the heavens, in conformity to which it continually
revolved night and day. Birds of silver were
carved in the other ceilings with surprising art.
Amulius, a celebrated artist, was employed during
the whole of his life to paint this palace. The tables
were of ivory, the floors of the rooms were intersected
with works in gold compartments of gems and
mother-of-pearl: the marble, the bronze, the statues,
and the richest of the tapestry, were beyond all description.
When Nero went to inhabit it, he said,
full of pride, &#8216;I now begin to be lodged like a man.&#8217;
Here, particularly, was a temple of Fortune, consecrated
by Servius Tullius, and constructed by Nero,
of a fine transparent alabaster, called fingites. This
stone was brought from Cappadocia, and was so clear,
that every object might be seen when the doors were
shut, as if it were noon-day. In the gardens were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
delightful baths, numerous fish-ponds and pastures,
with all sorts of animals. Here were also baths of
fresh and sea water. To erect these wonderful edifices
Italy was ruined with impositions and burdens,
and its temples spoiled of their precious ornaments,
statues of gold and silver, as likewise great part of
the empire. Tacitus writes in his Annals, that it was
twice burned and rebuilt; that is, in the fire under
Nero, and in the sixth year of Trajan. According
to Dion, it was burnt the third time under the emperor
Commodus; and, as he rebuilt it, it was called
from him Colonia Commodiana. Various emperors,
abhorring the excess of so much riches and luxury,
removed the most valuable part, and employed it for
the greater ornament of the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus.
Antoninus Pius, detesting the extent of the
palace, contented himself with the part called Tiberiana,
and shut up the rest. All this magnificence,
time, and especially the malignity of man, have destroyed,
and cypresses, symbols of death and desolation,
triumph on the ruins.&#8221;</p>

<p>Its present condition has been thus described by
the poet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Cypress and ivy, weed and wallflower, grown</span>
<span class="i1">Matted and massed together; hillocks heaped</span>

</div></div>

<p>Arches were public buildings,<a name="FNanchor_182_191" id="FNanchor_182_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_191" class="fnanchor">182</a> designed for the
reward and encouragement of noble enterprises,
erected generally to the honour of such eminent
persons as had either won a victory of extraordinary
consequence abroad, or had rescued the commonwealth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
at home from considerable danger. At first,
they were plain and rude structures, by no means
remarkable for beauty or state. But in later times
no expenses were thought too great for the rendering
them in the highest degree splendid and magnificent;
nothing being more usual than to have the greatest
actions of the heroes they stood to honour curiously
expressed, or the whole procession of the triumph
cut out on the sides. The arches built by Romulus
were only of brick; that of Camillus, of plain square
stone; but those of Cæsar, Drusus, Titus, Trajan,
Gordian, &amp;c., were entirely of marble.</p>

<p>The most distinguished of these arches are those
of Titus and Septimius Severus. That of Gallienus
is a mere gateway, and that of Drusus seems part
of an aqueduct; yet, coarse as they are, each has its
Corinthian columns, and pediments on a portion of
the fronts. That of Constantine was erected after
the defeat of Maxentius, and was so contrived that
the music for the triumph might be placed in it.
When the procession reached the arch, the band
began to play, and continued till the whole had passed
through.</p>

<p>The arch of Titus is situate on the eastern declivity
of the Palatine Mount. It is so rich, that
some regard it not as elegant. The entablature, the
imposts, the key-stones, are all crowded with sculpture;
yet all, according to the taste of Mr. Forsyth,
are meagre in profile. It was erected by the senate,
in gratitude to Titus for having conquered Judea and
taken Jerusalem. It is, therefore, one of the most
interesting monuments of ancient Rome; and so sensibly
do the Jews still feel the injury, done to their
nation, that none of them can be tempted to pass
under it.</p>

<p>The triumph is represented on each side of the
arch in oblong spaces, seven feet in height, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
nearly fourteen in length. The emperor appears in
a triumphal car drawn by four horses,&mdash;Victory
crowning him with a laurel. Rome is personified
as a female. She conducts the horses; lictors, citizens,
and soldiers, attending. On the opposite side
is represented a procession, in which are carried,
by persons crowned with laurel and bearing the
Roman standards, various spoils taken at Jerusalem;
such as the silver trumpets, the golden table, and
the golden candlestick with seven branches.</p>

<p>The arch of Severus was erected in honour of the
emperor Septimius, and his two sons Caracalla and
Geta, on account of victories obtained over the
Parthians. We know from history, says Dr.
Burton, that he made two expeditions into the
East; the first in 195, when he conquered Vologeses;
the second in 199, when he took Ctesiphon, and the
treasures of king Artabanus. Spartian tells us,
that he triumphed after the first expedition; but
refused the honour the second time, because he had
the gout. His son triumphed in his stead; and it
was upon this occasion that the arch was erected.</p>

<p>This triumphal arch consists of three; that is, a
large one in the middle, and a smaller one on each
side. These arches<a name="FNanchor_183_192" id="FNanchor_183_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_192" class="fnanchor">183</a> are not in a very pure style of
architecture; but they are rich and handsome objects.
Four projecting columns adorn each face, and the
entablature bricks around each of them. Above the
columns are supposed to have been statues; while,
on the top, as we learn from coins, was a car drawn
by six horses abreast, containing two persons in it,
and having on each side an attendant on horseback,
followed by one on foot. The material of the arch is
marble; and each front is covered, between the
columns, with bas-reliefs. These bas-reliefs illustrate
the campaigns and victories, in commemoration of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>which the arch was erected. But the whole series,
says Dr. Burton, is in an indifferent style of sculpture,
and presents but a poor idea of the state of the arts
at that time. Mr. Wood, however, regards them,
though bad in design as well as execution, as contributing
to the magnificence of the edifice. Mr.
Forsyth, however, is not given to indulge in respect
to the architecture; for he says, that the composite
starts so often and so &#8220;furiously&#8221; out, the poverty
of its entablature meets you in so many points, as
to leave no repose to the eye. Within the arch is a
marble staircase, leading by fifty steps to the summit.
The arch itself was half buried so late as the
year 1803. Several excavations had been made;
but the loose soil had slipped down, and quickly
filled them up again. Pope Pius VII. was more
successful in the attempt than his predecessors had
been; and by the year 1804 the whole arch had been
uncovered, and laid open down to the bottom.</p>

<p>The site of the temple of Romulus is now occupied
by the church of San Teodoro, a small rotunda.
The walls are of great antiquity, and marvellously
perfect. In regard to the temple of Romulus
and Remus, few buildings have occasioned more
disputes. It is now the church of S.S. Cosimo
e Damiano; the vestibule, several porphyry columns,
and a bronze door of which are exceedingly
ancient.</p>

<p>The temple of Vesta, erected by Numa, now
forms part of the church of S. Maria del Sola. It is
of Greek architecture, and surrounded by a portico
of nineteen Corinthian columns, on a flight of steps,
the whole of Parian marble. The roof was originally
covered with bronze, brought from Syracuse; but
that has, long since, been replaced by materials
much less costly.</p>

<p>The temple of Minerva Medici stands in a garden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
on the Esquiline-hill; it is round without, but forms
a decagon within, and appears to have had ten windows,
and nine niches for statues. Here were found
statues of &AElig;sculapius, Venus, Hercules, the Faun,
and that of Minerva with the serpent.</p>

<p>The church Sa. Maria in Cosmedin is supposed to
have been the temple of Puditia Patricia, or Chastity,
which no plebeian was allowed to enter. Pope
Adrian I. rebuilt this edifice in 728, retaining the
cella, and many portions of the ancient temple.</p>

<p>A mean-looking church, called Sa. Maria d&#8217; Ara
C&#339;li, wholly devoid of external ornament, is supposed
to stand on the site of the temple of Jupiter
Feretrius. A flight of one hundred and twenty-four
steps of marble, brought from the temple of Jupiter
Quirinus, forms the ascent to it from the Campus
Martius; the interior has twenty-two ancient columns
of granite, and the whole appears to be an
assemblage of fragments of other buildings. It was
whilst musing in this church, &#8220;whilst the friars were
singing vespers in the temple of Jupiter,&#8221; that Gibbon
says he first conceived the idea of writing his immortal
history.</p>

<p>The beautiful temple of Jupiter Tonans was erected
by Augustus, in gratitude for his escape from lightning.
Only three of the thirty columns of the portico
now remain, together with a portion of the
frieze. They are of Luna marble, four feet four
inches in diameter, with Corinthian capitals, and
appear originally to have been tinged with Tyrian
purple.</p>

<p>During the time of Claudius, the very curious
temple of Faunus was built upon the Celian mount.
It was of circular form, and had internally two rows
of Ionic columns, with arches springing immediately
from the capitals. The upper windows had each a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
column in the middle, with arches also springing
from the capitals; and these two arches were enclosed
by a semicircular arch, which had its springing
upon the jambs of the windows; and, rising
higher, left a considerable space between it and the
two before-mentioned small arches, in which space
was a circular opening. This is particularly noticed
as an early and distinct type of what was afterwards
named Saxon, Norman, and Gothic.</p>

<p>The temple of Concord was the place in which Lentulus
and other confederates of Catiline were brought
before the senate in order to be tried, and whence they
were taken to the Mamertine prisons. &#8220;For my own
part,&#8221; says Middleton, &#8220;as oft as I have been wandering
about in the very rostra of old Rome, or in
that of the temple of Concord, where Tully assembled
the senate in Catiline&#8217;s conspiracy, I could not help
fancying myself much more sensible of the force of
his eloquence; whilst the impression of the place
served to warm my imagination to a degree almost
equal to that of his old audience.&#8221; Of late years,
however, these ruins have been ascribed to the
temple of Fortune, burnt in the time of Maxentius,
the competitor of Constantine.</p>

<p>The temple of Fortune was, for a long time, taken
for the temple of Concord. Its portico is nearly
complete; consisting of six granite columns in front,
and two behind, supporting an entablature and pediment.
The columns all vary in diameter, and have
bases and capitals of white marble. From this circumstance
it is conjectured that it was erected with
the spoils of other buildings; their original temple,
burnt in the time of Maxentius, having been rebuilt
by Constantine.</p>

<p>The temple of Nerva was erected by Trajan. It
was one of the finest edifices of ancient Rome; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
all that now remains of it is a cella, and three fine
columns of Parian marble, fifty feet in height, supporting
an architrave.</p>

<p>The temple of Peace<a name="FNanchor_184_193" id="FNanchor_184_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_193" class="fnanchor">184</a>, erected by Vespasian, was
enriched with spoils from Jerusalem. This temple
is related to have been one of the most magnificent
in Rome: it was encircled with a coating of gilt
bronze, and adorned with stupendous columns of
white marble; it was also enriched with some of the
finest sculptures and paintings of which the ancient
world could boast<a name="FNanchor_185_194" id="FNanchor_185_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_194" class="fnanchor">185</a>. Among the former was a
colossal statue of the Nile, surrounded by sixteen
children, cut out of one block of basalt; among the
latter was the famous picture of Jalysus, painted by
Protogenes of Rhodes. Here, too, were deposited
the candlesticks, and some other of the spoils, which
Titus brought from Jerusalem. There was also a
curious library attached to the edifice.</p>

<p>Three immense arches, which rank amongst the
most remarkable remains in Rome, are all that are
left of this once stupendous structure, which, until
lately, was supposed to be the temple of Peace,
erected by Vespasian at the close of the Judean war.
But the great degeneracy of the workmanship, and
its being wholly unlike all erections of that nature,
has led to the opinion that the remains are neither
of the time of Vespasian, nor those of the temple,
which, with all the immense treasures it contained,
was destroyed by fire, about one hundred years after
its erection; but of a Basilica<a name="FNanchor_186_195" id="FNanchor_186_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_195" class="fnanchor">186</a>, erected by Maxentius
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>on the ruins of the temple, and converted by Constantine
into a Christian church. The stupendous
proportions of this structure are shown by the three
vaulted roofs, each seventy-five feet across, which
rise above the surrounding buildings in huge but not
ungainly masses. The vault of the middle arch, which
is placed further back, forms part of a sphere; the
side ones are cylindrical; all are ornamented with
sunk panels of stucco-work. The church appears to
have consisted of a nave and two aisles, divided by
enormous pillars of marble, one of which now stands
in front of the church of La Maria Maggiore. It is
of a single block, of forty-eight feet in height, and
sixteen and a half in circumference.</p>

<p>Of the fine temple, di Venere e Roma,<a name="FNanchor_187_196" id="FNanchor_187_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_196" class="fnanchor">187</a> the cella
of each deity remains, with the niches, in which
were their statues, and a portion of one of the side
walls, which prove it to have been of vast size, great
magnificence, and a chef-d&#8217;&#339;uvre of architecture.
The emperor Adrian himself drew the plans, which
he submitted to Apollodorus, whose opinion respecting
them is said to have been the cause of his
untimely death. The temples, although they had
each a separate entrance and cella, formed but one
edifice; the substructure of which, having been
recently excavated, is found to have been three
hundred and thirty by one hundred and sixty feet.
A noble flight of steps, discovered at the same time,
between the arch of Titus and the church of St.
Francesco, formed the approach of the Forum, which
front, as well as that towards the Coliseum, was
adorned with columns of Parian marble, six feet in
diameter; and the whole was surrounded by a portico,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
with a double row of columns of grey granite.
The walls and pavement of the interior were incrusted
with fine marble, and the roof richly gilt.</p>

<p>The Temple of Antoninus was erected by Marcus
Aurelius in 178, in memory of Antoninus and
his consort Faustina. The original portico, consisting
of ten Corinthian columns of Cippolino
marble, and a portion of the temple itself, now form
the church of S. Lorenzo in Miranda.</p>

<p>The column of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus was
erected by the senate in honour of that illustrious
emperor. Bassi-rilievi run spirally from the bottom
to the top, representing the Marcomannian war. It
is composed of twenty-six blocks of Parian marble,
and is one hundred and twenty-three feet in height.
The statue of the emperor once stood on its summit,
but it has been replaced by that of St. Paul.</p>

<p>This leads us to speak of the great statue of the
same emperor. The horse was so greatly admired
by Michael Angelo, that when he first saw it, he
looked at it in silence for some time, and then said,
&#8220;Go on!&#8221; &#8220;This great statue of Marcus Aurelius,&#8221;
says Mr. Forsyth, &#8220;or rather of his horse, which
was once the idol of Rome, is now a subject of contention.
Some critics find the proportions of the
animal false, and his attitude impossible. One compares
his head to an owl, another his belly to a cow&#8217;s,
but the well-known apostrophe of a third (Michael
Angelo) will ever prevail in your first impressions.
The spirit and fire of the general figure will seduce
the most practised eye. Ancient sculptors, intent
only on man, are supposed to have neglected the
study of animals; and we certainly find very rude
accessories affixed to some exquisite antiques. Perhaps
they affected such contrasts as strike us in the
work of the Faun and his panther, the Meleager and
his dogs, the Apollo and his swans, where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
accessory serves as a foil. The horse, however,
comes so frequently into heroic subjects, that the
greatest artists of antiquity must have made him
their particular study, and we are told that they did
so; but it were unfair to judge of their excellence
from this bruised and unfortunate animal.&#8221;</p>

<p>This celebrated statue is the only one of bronze of
all that adorned the city in ancient times. It has
been called, at different periods, by the names of
Lucius Verus, Septimius Severus, and Constantine.
It was placed in its present position by Paul III. in
1538, being then removed from before the church of
St. John Lateran. A bunch of flowers is said to
be presented every year to the chapter of St. John,
as an acknowledgment, that the statue belongs to
them; but this Sir John Hobhouse denies. The
statue was originally gilt; the coating laid on, according
to the practice of the ancients, in very thick
leaves; and some traces of it may still be observed.</p>

<p>We now turn to the Coliseum. The shows of wild
beasts were in general designed for the honour of
Diana, the patroness of hunting. For this purpose,
no cost was spared to fetch the different creatures
from the farthest parts of the world.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i7">Part in laden vessels came,</span>
<span class="i0">Borne on the rougher waves, or gentler stream;</span>
<span class="i0">The fainting man let fall his trembling oar,</span>
<span class="i0">And the pale master feared the freight he bore.</span>
</div></div>

<p>And shortly after,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All that with potent teeth command the plain,</span>
<span class="i0">All that run horrid with erected mane,</span>
<span class="i0">Or proud of stately horns, or bristling hair,</span>
<span class="i0">At once the forest&#8217;s ornament and fear;</span>
<span class="i0">Torn from their deserts by the Roman power,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor strength can save, nor craggy dens secure.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Some creatures were presented merely as strange
sights and rarities; as crocodiles, and several outlandish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
birds and beasts: others for the combat, as
lions, tigers, leopards, &amp;c. We may reckon up three
sorts of diversions with the beasts, which all went
under the common name of Venatio:&mdash;The first,
when the people were permitted to run after the
beasts, and catch what they could for their own
use; the second, when the beasts fought with one
another; and the last, when they were brought out
to engage with men.<a name="FNanchor_188_197" id="FNanchor_188_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_197" class="fnanchor">188</a></p>

<p>The fights between beasts were exhibited with
great variety; sometimes a tiger was matched with
a lion; sometimes a lion with a bull; a bull with an
elephant; a rhinoceros with a bear, &amp;c. But the
most wonderful sight was, when by bringing water
into the amphitheatre, huge sea-monsters were introduced
to combat with wild beasts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No sylvan monsters we alone have view&#8217;d,</span>
<span class="i0">But huge sea calves, dyed red with hostile blood</span>
<span class="i0">Of bears, lie floundering in the wondrous flood.</span>
<span class="i10"><span class="smcap">Calphurn.</span> Eclog. vii.</span>
</div></div>

<p>The men, that engaged with wild beasts, had the
common name of Bestiarii. Some of these were
condemned persons; others hired themselves at a
set pay, like the Gladiators; and like them, too,
had their schools where they were instructed and
initiated in such combats. We find several of the
nobility and gentry many times voluntarily undertaking
a part in these encounters; and Juvenal
acquaints us, that the very women were ambitious
of showing their courage on the like occasions,
though with the forfeiture of their modesty.</p>

<p>One of the best accounts of this wonderful edifice, is
that given in Burford&#8217;s account of the Panorama
painted by himself, and now (1839,) exhibiting in Leicester
Square, London. &#8220;The far-famed amphitheatre
of Vespasian, or, as it is more generally called,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>the Coliseum, is one of the most extraordinary and
massive works, that Rome, or any other country,
ever produced; and forms one of the most surprising,
and intensely interesting, objects of attraction
amongst the many gigantic remains of that ancient
city. In whatever way it is viewed, whether as
regards its immense size, the solidity of its structure,
the simplicity and harmony of its architecture, the
grace and beauty of its proportions, or its internal
arrangement and convenience, it equally strikes the
mind with wonder and admiration; and is universally
admitted to be one of the noblest remains of
antiquity in the world. Placed at some distance
from the gorgeous churches, extensive palaces, and
busy streets of modern Rome, it stands alone in
solitary dignity and gloomy contrast; elevating its
stupendous masses from above the surrounding ruins
of the imperial city; a striking image of Rome itself
in its present state, erect on the one side, fallen on
the other; half grey, half green, deserted and decaying;
a splendid and melancholy monument of past
greatness; and no monument of human power, no memorial
of departed ages, ever spoke more forcibly to
the heart, or awakened feelings so powerful, and unutterable.
The Coliseum was commenced by Flavius
Vespasian, in the year 72, as a triumphal
memorial of his victories in Judea; and it also
served to perpetuate the recollection of the many
horrid cruelties, committed by the conquering Romans
during that war. It was erected, according
to Martial and Pliny, on the spot formerly occupied
by a lake or fish-pond, in the gardens of Nero&#8217;s
golden house, then nearly the centre of the city.
Twelve thousand Jewish prisoners, reduced to slavery,
were employed on the work; and when it is
considered, that so large and solid an edifice was
completed in little more than four years, it becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
clearly evident, that the utmost cruelty and oppression
must have been resorted to, to compel these
unfortunates to complete the task. Titus, the son of
Vespasian, finished the building; and on its dedication
exhibited shows and games for one hundred
days, during which numbers of gladiators were
killed, and five thousand wild beasts were torn to
pieces in the arena.&#8221;</p>

<p>This vast amphitheatre is of an elliptical shape,
which gives it great powers of resistance. According
to the best and most recent measurement, it
must be about one thousand one hundred and eighty
eight feet in external circumference, the long axis
being six hundred and twenty-eight, the short five
hundred and forty, and the total height one hundred
and sixty feet.<a name="FNanchor_189_198" id="FNanchor_189_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_198" class="fnanchor">189</a> The whole is a vast mixed mass of
enormous blocks of stone and bricks, (probably portions
of the golden palace), metal and cement, which
have become so hardened by time, as to be like solid
rock. The exterior was entirely of calcareous tufa of
Tivoli, called travertine, a fine hard and white stone.
It presents a series of three ranges of open arcades,
so airy and correct in their proportions, that the
building does not appear so large as it really is.
Each tier consisted of thirty arches; the columns
between which, together with the entablatures, displaying
different orders of architecture, the lowest
being Doric, the second Ionic, and the third Corinthian,
surmounted by an attic story, with Composite
pilasters, and forty windows. The two upper tiers
of arches, which have the remains of pedestals for
statues in them, admitted light to the various ambulacra
or corridors, which were quadrangular at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>base, diminishing in number and size as they ascended,
and terminating in a single passage at the top. The
lowest tier of arches were the entrances, seventy-six
of which were for the emperor, finely ornamented;
one for the spectators, of various denominations;
and one for the consuls, senators, &amp;c.; and two
for the gladiators, animals, &amp;c. These entrances
led to the various staircases by which the populace
gained the different dormitories, and descended by
narrow flights of steps, to the graduated ranges of
seats. Altogether there were one hundred and sixty
staircases: that is,&mdash;to the first floor, sixty-four; to
the second, fifty-two; to the third, sixteen; to the
fourth, twenty-four; and four to the extreme top, for
the workmen. In the four ambulacra on the ground
floor, were shops, taverns, stables, and rooms for
refreshments, and places where perfumes were burned.
There was also a fifth, or private passage, under the
pulvinar, for the use of the emperor, which communicated
subterraneously with the palace. In the tier
above were twenty-two small vaulted chambers,
called fornices, devoted to the sensual pleasures of
the privileged classes.</p>

<p>It is impossible to say at what period the amphitheatre
was first suffered to decay. The sanguinary
exhibitions of the gladiators were abolished in the
reign of Honorius, at the commencement of the fifth
century; yet so late as 1632, it must have been perfect,
as bull-fights, and other games, were at that time
exhibited. A great portion of the southern side was
demolished by order of Paul III., it is said at the
recommendation of Michael Angelo, to furnish materials
for the Farnese palace for his nephew, and the
complaints of the populace alone saved it from total
demolition. It has however since suffered frequently
from similar depredations of worse than Goths and
Vandals, so that</p>

<p>These robberies have now ceased; Benedict XIV.
having, by the erection of a series of altars in the
arena, made the whole consecrated ground; a most
efficient protection against the ravages of modern
barbarism. Pius has also erected a massive buttress
against the weakest end, and repaired some parts of
the interior. Thus, after a lapse of nearly eighteen
centuries, having frequently suffered from earthquakes,
storms, and fire; having been several times battered
as a fortress, during the civil contentions of the middle
ages; defaced as a quarter for soldiers; used as a
manufactory, and worked as a quarry, it still remains
a miracle of human labour and ingenuity, and is, even
in its present state, one of the noblest remains of antiquity,
and the most wonderful monument of Roman
magnificence. Solitary and desolated, it is still grand
and imposing; the rich hues which time has overspread
its venerable fragments with, the luxuriant
clusters of vegetation, and the graceful drapery of
numerous beautiful creepers, festooning from the
rifted arches, and broken arcades, whilst assimilating
with the general character, add an indescribable richness
and variety to the whole, that has a powerful
effect on the mind of the spectator.</p>

<p>When the whole amphitheatre was entire<a name="FNanchor_190_199" id="FNanchor_190_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_199" class="fnanchor">190</a>, a child
might comprehend its design in a moment, and go
direct to his place without straying in the porticoes;
for each arcade bears its number engraved, and opposite
each arcade was a staircase. This multiplicity of
wide, straight, and separate passages, proves the attention
which the ancients paid to the safe discharge
of a crowd.<a name="FNanchor_191_200" id="FNanchor_191_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_200" class="fnanchor">191</a> As it now stands, the Coliseum is a
striking image of Rome itself;&mdash;decayed, vacant, serious;
yet grand:&mdash;half grey, and half green; erect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>on one side and fallen on the other, with consecrated
ground in its bosom, inhabited by a herdsman; visited
by every caste: for moralists, antiquaries, painters,
architects, devotees, all meet here to meditate, to examine,
to draw, to measure, and to copy.</p>

<p>The figure of the Coliseum was an ellipse, whose
longer diameter was about six hundred and fifteen
English feet, and the shorter five hundred and ten feet.
The longer diameter of the arena, or space within,
was about two hundred and eighty-one feet, and
the shorter one hundred and seventy-six feet, leaving
the circuit for seats and galleries, of about one
hundred and fifty-seven feet in breadth. The outward
circumference when complete was about seventeen
hundred and seventy-two feet, covering a surface
of about two hundred and forty-six thousand, six hundred
and sixty-one feet, or something more than five
acres and a half. When some pilgrims<a name="FNanchor_192_201" id="FNanchor_192_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_201" class="fnanchor">192</a> who journeyed
to Rome beheld this vast amphitheatre, they are said to
have exclaimed, &#8220;As long as the Coliseum stands,
Rome shall stand; when the Coliseum falls, Rome
will fall; and when Rome falls, the world will fall.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_193_202" id="FNanchor_193_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_202" class="fnanchor">193</a>It is impossible to contemplate without horror
the dreadful scenes of carnage which for two hundred
and fifty years disgraced the amphitheatre, or
to regard without utter detestation the character of
the people who took pleasure in spectacles of such
monstrous brutality. We may form some idea of the
myriads of men and animals destroyed in these houses
of slaughter, from one instance which is recorded by
Dio. He informs us that after the triumph of Trajan
over the Dacians, spectacles were exhibited for one
hundred and twenty-three days, in which eleven
thousand animals were killed, and one thousand gladiators
were matched against each other. Nor was
it only malefactors, captives, and slaves, that were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>doomed to contend in these dreadful games: free-born
citizens hired themselves as gladiators, men of noble
birth sometimes degraded themselves so far as to
fight on the stage for the amusement of their countrymen,&mdash;even
women, ladies too of high rank, forgetting
the native delicacy and the feebleness of their
sex, strove on the arena for the prize of valour for the
honour of adroitness in murder. A people thus inured
to blood, were prepared for every villainy; nor
is it possible to read of the enormities which disgraced
the transactions of the later Romans, without ascribing
them in a great measure to the ferocity of temper,
fostered by the shocking amusements of the amphitheatre.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Coliseo,&#8221; says Dupaty, &#8220;is unquestionably
the most admirable monument of the Roman power
under the Cæsars. From its vast circuit, from the multitude
of stones of which it is formed, from that union
of columns of every order, which rise up one above the
other, in a circular form, to support three rows of
porticoes; from all the dimensions, in a word, of this
prodigious edifice, we instantly recognise the work
of a people, sovereigns of the universe, and slaves of
an emperor. I wandered long around the Coliseo,
without venturing, if I may so say, to enter it: my
eyes surveyed it with admiration and awe. Not
more than one half of this vast edifice at present is
standing; yet the imagination may still add what
has been destroyed, and complete the whole. At
length I entered within its precincts. What an
astonishing scene! What contrasts! What a display
of ruins, and of all the parts of the monument, of
every form, every age, and, as I may say, every
year; some bearing the marks of the hand of time,
and others of the hand of the barbarian. These
crumbled down yesterday, those a few days before,
a great number on the point of falling, and some, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
short, which are falling from one moment to another.
Here we see a tottering portico, there a falling entablament,
and further on, a seat; while, in the meanwhile,
the ivy, the bramble, the moss, and various
plants, creep amongst these ruins, grow, and insinuate
themselves; and, taking root in the cement, are
continually detaching, separating, and reducing to
powder these enormous masses; the work of ages,
piled on each other by the will of an emperor, and
the labour of a hundred thousand slaves.  There
was it then that gladiators, martyrs, and slaves,
combated on the Roman festivals, only to make the
blood circulate a little quicker in the veins of a
hundred thousand idle spectators. I thought I still
heard the roaring of the lions, the sighs of the dying,
the voice of the executioners, and what would strike
my ear with still greater horror, the applauses of
the Romans. I thought I heard them, by these
applauses, encouraging and demanding carnage; the
men requiring still more blood from the combatants;
and the women, more mercy for the dying. I imagined
I beheld one of these women, young and
beautiful, on the fall of a gladiator, rise from her seat
and with an eye which had just caressed a lover,
welcome, or repel, find fault with, or applaud, the last
sigh of the vanquished, as if she had paid for it.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what a change has taken place in this arena!
In the middle stands a crucifix, and all round this
crucifix, at equal distances, fourteen altars, consecrated
to different saints, are erected in the dens,
which once contained the wild beasts. The Coliseo
was daily hastening to destruction; the stones were
carried off, and it was constantly disfigured, and
made the receptacle of filth; when Benedict XIV.
conceived the idea of saving this noble monument by
consecrating it; by defending it with altars, and protecting
it with indulgences. These walls, these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
columns, and these porticoes, have now no other support
but the names of those very martyrs with
whose blood they were formerly stained. I walked
through every part of the Coliseo; I ascended into
all its different stories; and sat down in the box of
the emperors. I shall long remember the silence and
solitude that reigned through these galleries, along
these ranges of seats, and under these vaulted porticoes.
I stopped from time to time to listen to the
echo of my feet in walking. I was delighted, too,
with attending to a certain faint rustling, more
sensible to the soul than to the ear, occasioned by
the hand of time, which is continually at work, and
undermining the Coliseo on every side. What pleasure
did I not enjoy, too, in observing how the day
gradually retired, and the night as gradually advanced
over the arcades, spreading her lengthening
shadows. At length I was obliged to retire; with
my mind, however, filled with and absorbed in a
thousand ideas, a thousand sensations, which can
only arise among these ruins, and which these
ruins in some degree inspire. Where are the five
thousand wild beasts that tore each other to pieces, on
the day on which this mighty pile was opened?
Silent now are those unnatural shouts of applause,
called forth by the murderous fights of the gladiators:&mdash;What
a contrast to this death of sound!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ascending among the ruins,&#8221; says Mr. Williams,
&#8220;we took our station where the whole magnitude
of the Coliseum was visible. What a fulness
of mind the first glance excited; yet how inexpressible,
at the same time, were our feelings! The
awful silence of this dread ruin still appealed to our
hearts. The single sentinel&#8217;s tread, and the ticking
of our watches, were the only sounds we heard,
while the moon was marching in the vault of night,
and the stars were peeping through the various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
openings; the shadows of the flying clouds being all
that reminded us of life and of motion.&#8221;</p>

<p>The manner, in which the traveller should survey
the curiosities of Rome, must be determined by the
length of time which he can afford for that purpose.
&#8220;There are two modes of seeing Rome,&#8221; says Mr.
Mathews; &#8220;the topographical, followed by Vasi,
who parcels out the town into eight divisions, and
jumbles every thing together,&mdash;antiquities, churches,
and palaces, if their situation be contiguous; and
the chronological,&mdash;which would carry you regularly
from the house of Romulus to the palace of the
reigning pontiff. The first mode is the most expeditious,
and the least expensive; for even if the traveller
walk afoot, the economy of time is worth considering;
and after all that can be urged in favour
of the chronological order, on the score of reason,
Vasi&#8217;s plan is perhaps the best. For all that is
worth seeing at all is worth seeing twice. Vasi&#8217;s
mode hurries you through every thing; but it enables
you to select and note down those objects that are
worthy of public examination, and these may be
afterwards studied at leisure. Of the great majority
of sights it must be confessed that all we obtain for
our labour is the knowledge that they are not worth
seeing;&mdash;but this is a knowledge, that no one is
willing to receive upon the authority of another, and
Vasi&#8217;s plan offers a most expeditious mode of arriving
at this truth by one&#8217;s own proper experience. His
plan is, however, too expeditious; for he would get
through the whole town, with all its wonders, ancient
and modern, in eight days!&#8221;</p>

<p>Expeditious as it is, some of our indefatigable
countrymen have contrived to hit upon one still
more so. You may tell them that the antiquaries
allow eight days for the tour, and they will boast
of having beaten the antiquaries, and &#8220;done it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
six.&#8221; This rapid system may do, or rather must do,
for those who have no time for any other; but to
the traveller who wishes to derive instruction and
profit from his visit, a more leisurely survey is
essential. &#8220;For my own part,&#8221; says Mr. Woods,
&#8220;the first eight days I spent in Rome were all hurry
and confusion, and I could attend to nothing systematically,
nor even examine any thing with accuracy;
a sort of restless eagerness to see every thing and
know every thing, gave me no power of fixing my
attention on any one particular.&#8221;</p>

<p>We must now close our account: not that we
have by any means exhausted the subject, for it demands
volumes and years; whereas our space is
limited, and our time is short. We shall, therefore,
devote the remainder of our space and time to the
impressions with which the ruins of this city have
been viewed by several elegant and accomplished
travellers.</p>

<p>&#8220;At length I behold Rome,&#8221; said Dupaty. &#8220;I
behold that theatre, where human nature has been
all that it can ever be, has performed every thing it
can perform, has displayed all the virtues, exhibited
all the vices, brought forth the sublimest heroes,
and the most execrable monsters, has been elevated
to a Brutus, degraded to a Nero, and re-ascended
to a Marcus Aurelius.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even those who have not read at all,&#8221; says Dr.
Burton, &#8220;know, perhaps, more of the Romans than
of any other nation<a name="FNanchor_194_203" id="FNanchor_194_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_203" class="fnanchor">194</a> which has figured in the world.
If we prefer modern history to ancient, we still find
Rome in every page; and if we look with composure
upon an event so antiquated as the fall of the Roman
empire, we cannot, as Englishmen, or as protestants,
contemplate with indifference the sacred empire which
Rome erected over the minds and consciences of men.
Without making any invidious allusion, it may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>said that this second empire has nearly passed away;
so that, in both points of view, we have former recollections
to excite our curiosity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither the superb structures,&#8221; says Sir John
Hobhouse, &#8220;nor the happy climate, have made Rome
the country of every man, and &#8216;the city of the soul.&#8217;
The education, which has qualified the traveller of
every nation for that citizenship, prepares enjoyments
for him at Rome, independent of the city and inhabitants
about him, and of all the allurements of site and
climate. He will already people the banks of the
Tiber with the shades of Pompey, Constantine, and
Belisarius, and other heroes. The first footsteps within
the venerable walls will have shown him the name and
magnificence of Augustus, and the three long narrow
streets, branching from the obelisk in the centre of
the Piazza del Popolo, like the theatre of Palladio,
will have imposed upon his fancy with an air of
antiquity congenial to the soil. Even the mendicants
of the country asking alms in Latin prayers, and the
vineyard gates of the suburbs, inscribed with the
ancient language, may be allowed to contribute to
the agreeable delusion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What,&#8221; says Chateaubriand, gazing on the ruins
of Rome by moonlight, &#8220;what was doing here eighteen
centuries ago, at a like hour of night? Not only
has ancient Italy vanished, but the Italy of the middle
ages is also gone. Nevertheless, the traces of both
are plainly marked at Rome. If this modern city
vaunts her St. Peter&#8217;s, ancient Rome opposes her
Pantheon and all her ruins; if the one marshals from
the Capitol her consuls and emperors, the other
arrays her long succession of pontiffs. The Tiber
divides the rival glories; seated in the same dust,
pagan Rome sinks faster and faster into decay, and
Christian Rome is gradually re-descending into the
catacombs whence she issued.&#8221;</p>

<p>What says Lord Byron in regard to this celebrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
city?&mdash;&#8220;I am delighted with Rome. As a whole&mdash;ancient
and modern&mdash;it beats Greece, Constantinople,
every thing,&mdash;at least that I have seen. As for the
Coliseum, Pantheon, St. Peter&#8217;s, the Vatican, &amp;c. &amp;c.,
they are quite inconceivable, and must be <i>seen</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>We close this article with a fine passage from
Middleton&#8217;s Life of Cicero:&mdash;&#8220;One cannot help reflecting
on the surprising fate and revolutions of
kingdoms; how Rome, once the mistress of the world,
the seat of arts, empire, and glory, now lies sunk in
sloth, ignorance, and poverty, enslaved to the most
cruel, as well as the most contemptible of tyrants,
superstition and religious imposture; while this
remote country, anciently the jest and contempt of
the polite Romans, is become the happy seat of
liberty, plenty, and letters; flourishing in all the
arts and refinements of civil life; yet running, perhaps,
the same course which Rome itself had run
before,&mdash;from virtuous industry to wealth; from
wealth to luxury; from luxury to an impatience of
discipline and corruption of morals; till, by a total
degeneracy and loss of virtue, being grown ripe for
destruction, it falls a prey at last to some hardy
oppressor; and, with the loss of liberty, losing every
thing that is valuable, sinks gradually again into
original barbarism.&#8221;</p>

<h2>NO. XXII.&mdash;SAGUNTUM.</h2>

<p><i>Proud and cruel nation! every thing must be
yours, and at your disposal! You are to prescribe
to us with whom we shall make war; with whom we
shall make peace! You are to set bounds; to shut
us up between hills and rivers: but you&mdash;you are
not to observe the limits which yourselves have fixed.
Pass not the Iberus. What next? Touch not the
Saguntines. Saguntum is upon the Iberus; move
not a step towards that city.</i></p>

<p class="right">HANNIBAL&#8217;S SPEECH TO HIS SOLDIERS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saguntum</span> was a celebrated city of Hispania
Taraconensis, on the west side of the Iberus, about a
mile from the sea-shore. It was founded by a colony
of Zacynthians, and by some of the Rutili of Ardea<a name="FNanchor_196_205" id="FNanchor_196_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_205" class="fnanchor">196</a>.</p>

<p>Saguntum, according to Livy, acquired immense
riches, partly from its commerce both by land and sea,
and partly from its just laws and excellent police.</p>

<p>Saguntum was under the protection of the Romans,
if not numbered amongst its cities; and when by a
treaty made between that people and the Carthaginians,
the latter were permitted to carry their arms
as far as the Iberus, this city was excepted.</p>

<p>The moment Hannibal was created general, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>lost no time, for fear of being prevented by death, as
his father had been. Though the Spaniards had so
much advantage over him, with regard to the number
of forces, their army amounting to upwards of one
hundred thousand men, yet he chose his time and
posts so happily, that he entirely defeated them.
After this every thing submitted to his arms. But
he still forbore laying siege to Saguntum, carefully
avoiding every occasion of a rupture with the Romans,
till he should be furnished with all things necessary
for so important an enterprise;&mdash;pursuant to the advice
of his father. He applied himself particularly to
engage the affections of the citizens and allies, and to
gain their confidence, by allotting them a large share
of the plunder taken from the enemy, and by paying
them all their arrears.</p>

<p>The Saguntines, on their side, sensible of the
danger with which they were threatened, from the
continued successes of Hannibal, advertised the
Romans of them. Upon this, deputies were nominated
by the latter, and ordered to go and take a
personal information upon the spot; they commanded
them also to lay their complaints before Hannibal, if
it should be thought proper; and in case he should
refuse to do justice, that then they should go directly
to Carthage, and make the same complaints. In
the meantime, Hannibal laid siege to Saguntum, promising
himself great advantages from the taking of
this city. He was persuaded that this would deprive
the Romans of all hopes of carrying the war
into Spain; that this new conquest would secure
the old ones; and that no enemy would be left behind
him; that he should find money enough in it
for the execution of his designs; that the plunder of
the city would inspire his soldiers with great ardour,
and make them follow him with greater cheerfulness;
and that, lastly, the spoils which he should send to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
Carthage would gain him the favour of the citizens.
Animated by these motives, he carried on the siege
with the utmost vigour.</p>

<p>News was soon carried to Rome, that Saguntum
was besieged. But the Romans, instead of flying
to its relief, lost their time in fruitless debates, and
equally insignificant disputations. The Saguntines
were now reduced to the last extremity, and in want
of all things. An accommodation was thereupon proposed;
but the conditions on which it was offered,
appeared so harsh, that the Saguntines could not so
much as think of accepting them. Before they gave
their final answer, the principal senators, bringing
their gold and silver, and that of the public treasury,
into the market-place, threw both into a fire, lighted
for that purpose, and afterwards themselves! At the
same time, a tower which had been long assaulted
by the battering-rams, falling with a dreadful noise,
the Carthaginians entered the city by the breach,
and soon made themselves masters of it, and cut to
pieces all the inhabitants, who were of sufficient age
to bear arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Words,&#8221; says Polybius, &#8220;could never express the
grief and consternation with which the news of the
taking, and cruel fate of Saguntum, was received
at Rome. Compassion for an unfortunate city, shame
for their having failed to succour such faithful allies,
a just indignation against the Carthaginians, the
authors of all these calamities; the strong alarms,
raised by the successes of Hannibal, whom the
Romans fancied they saw already at their gates; all
these sentiments were so violent, that, during the
first moments of them, the Romans were unable to
come to any resolution, or do any thing, but give
way to the torrent of their passion, and sacrifice
floods of tears to the memory of a city, which lay in
ruins because of its inviolable fidelity to the Romans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
and had been betrayed by their imprudent delays,
and unaccountable indolence. When they were a
little recovered, an assembly of the people was called,
and war unanimously declared against the people of
Carthage.&#8221;</p>

<p>The conqueror afterwards rebuilt it, and placed a
garrison there, with all the noblemen whom he had
detained as hostages, from the several neighbouring
nations of Spain<a name="FNanchor_197_206" id="FNanchor_197_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_206" class="fnanchor">197</a>.</p>

<p>The city remained in a deplorable state of distress
under the Carthaginians, till the year of Rome 538,
when Scipio, having humbled the power of Carthage
in Spain, in process of time recovered Saguntum,
and made it, as Pliny says, &#8220;a new city.&#8221; By the
Romans it was treated with every kind of distinction;
but at some period, not ascertained by historians, it
was reduced to ruins.</p>

<p>The city of Morviedro is supposed to be situated
on the ruins of Saguntum; the name of which being
derived from <i>Muri veteres</i>, <i>Muros viejos</i>, &#8220;old walls.&#8221;
It abounds with vestiges of antiquity. Several Celtiberian
and Roman inscriptions are seen; but of all
the numerous statues that the temples, and other
public edifices of Saguntum once had, only one remains,
of white marble, without a head; besides the
fragment of another.</p>

<p>The traces of the walls of its circus are, nevertheless,
still discernible; though its mosaic pavement
is destroyed. A greater portion of the theatre remains
than of any other Roman monument.</p>

<p>A writer on Spanish antiquities in 1684, gives the
following account of this city, whereby we may learn
that at that time there were many more remains of
antiquity then there are at present. &#8220;The Roman
inscriptions,&#8221; says he, &#8220;that are scattered up and
down in the public and private buildings, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>medals and other monuments of antiquity, that have
been found there, being endless, I shall only present
my reader with that which is over one of the gates of
the town, in honour of the emperor Claudius:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;And upon another gate, near the cathedral, is a
head of Hannibal, cut in stone. From hence, if you
mount still higher up the rock, you come to an amphitheatre,
which has twenty-six rows of seats one
above another, all cut in the rock; and in the other
parts the arches are so thick and strong, that they
are little inferior to the rock itself. There are remains
of prodigious aqueducts, and numbers of vast cisterns
under ground. As this country has been celebrated
by Titus Livius, and Polybius, for its fertility, I
shall take notice of one or two of its productions,
which are peculiar to it. First then, the winter figs,
which Pliny speaks of, are to be met with in great
perfection at this day; and are almost as remarkable
for their flavour and sweetness, as for their hanging
upon the trees in the middle of the winter. Their
pears also have a higher reputation than any others.
There are cherry-trees that are full of fine fruit in
January: and in a place near Canet, about half a
league off, they raised a melon that weighed thirty
pounds<a name="FNanchor_198_207" id="FNanchor_198_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_207" class="fnanchor">198</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sais</span> stands on the eastern side of the Nile, near the
place where a canal, passing across the Delta, joins
the Pelusiac with the Canopic branch of the Nile.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>
<p>It was the metropolis of Lower Egypt; and its inhabitants
were, originally, an Athenian colony.</p>

<p>At this place there was a temple dedicated to
Minerva, who is supposed to be the same as Isis,
with the following inscription:&mdash;&#8220;I am whatever
hath been, and is, and shall be; no mortal hath yet
pierced through the veil that shrouds me.&#8221;</p>

<p>In this city Osiris is said to have been buried.
&#8220;They have a tomb at Sais,&#8221; says Herodotus, &#8220;of a
certain personage, whom I do not think myself permitted
to specify. It is behind the Temple of Minerva,
and is continued by the whole length of the wall of
that building: around this are many large obelisks,
near which is a lake, whose banks are lined with
stone. It is of a circular form, and, I should think,
as large as that of Delos, which is called Trochoeides.&#8221;</p>

<p>To name this &#8220;personage&#8221; seems to have been an
act carefully to be avoided. How very sacred the
ancients deemed their mysteries appears from the following
passage in Apollonius Rhodius:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&#8220;To Samothrace, Electra&#8217;s isle, they steer:</span>
<span class="i0">That there, initiated in rights divine,</span>
<span class="i0">Safe might they sail the navigable brine.</span>
<span class="i0">But Muse, presume not of those rights to tell.</span>
<span class="i0">Farewell, dread isle, dire deities, farewell!</span>
<span class="i0">Let not my verse these mysteries explain;</span>
<span class="i0">To name is impious, to reveal profane.&#8221;</span>
</div></div>

<p>In this temple (that of Minerva) Herodotus informs
us the inhabitants buried their princes; and in
the area before it stood a large marble edifice, magnificently
adorned with obelisks in the shape of palm-trees,
with various other ornaments. This temple
was erected by Amasis, who was a native of Sais.<a name="FNanchor_199_208" id="FNanchor_199_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_208" class="fnanchor">199</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
In magnitude and grandeur it surpassed any they had
before seen; of such enormous size were the stones
employed in the building and foundation. There was
a room cut out of one stone, which had been conveyed
by water from Elephantis by the labour of two
thousand men; costing three years&#8217; labour. This
stone measured on the outside twenty-one cubits
long, fourteen broad, and eight high.</p>

<p>Cambyses entertained a mortal hatred to the
monarch just mentioned. From Memphis he went to
Sais, where was the burying-place of the kings of
Egypt. As soon as he entered the palace, he caused
the body of Amasis to be taken out of its tomb, and after
having exposed it to a thousand indignities in his own
presence, he ordered it to be cast into the fire and
burned; which was a thing equally contrary to the customs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
of the Persians and Egyptians. The rage, this
prince testified against the dead body of Amasis,
shows to what a degree he hated his person. Whatever
was the cause of this aversion, it seems to have
been one of the chief motives, Cambyses had of carrying
his arms into Egypt.</p>

<p>The first notice of the ruins of Sais, by Europeans,
occurs in the travels of Egmont and Heyman,
two Dutchmen, who found a curious inscription in
honour of its &#8220;benefactor,&#8221; Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.
They saw also a colossal statue of a female, with
hieroglyphics. Fourteen camel-loads of treasure are
said to have been found among the ruins.</p>

<p>&#8220;The village of Sé&#8217;l Hajar,&#8221; says Dr. Clarke,
&#8220;seems in the suburban district of the ancient city;
for as we proceeded hence in an eastern direction we
soon discerned its vestiges. Irregular heaps, containing
ruined foundations which had defied the labours
of the peasants, appeared between the village, and
some more considerable remains farther towards the
south-east. The earth was covered with fragments
of the ancient terra-cotta, which the labourers had
cast out of their sieves. At the distance of about
three furlongs we came to an immense quadrangular
inclosure, nearly a mile wide, formed by high walls,
or rather mounds of earth, facing the four points of
the compass, and placed at right angles to each other,
so as to surround the spacious area. In the centre of
this was another conical heap, supporting the ruins of
some building, whose original form cannot be now
ascertained. The ramparts of this inclosure are indeed
so lofty as to be visible from the river, although
at this distance, the irregularity of their appearance
might cause a person ignorant of their real nature to
mistake them for natural eminences.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Clarke found several things at Sais well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
worthy attention; among which may be particularly
mentioned several bronze relics; an ara-triform
sceptre, a curious hieroglyphic tablet<a name="FNanchor_200_209" id="FNanchor_200_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_209" class="fnanchor">200</a>, the torso of
an ancient statue, a triple hierogram with the symbol
of the cross, and several other antiquities.</p>

<p>On the east is another fragment of a very highly
finished edifice; and the hieroglyphics which remain
are perfectly well sculptured.</p>

<p>Many fragments of these ruins have been, of late
years, taken away by Mohamed Bey, to build therewith
a miserable palace at E&#8217;Sooan<a name="FNanchor_201_210" id="FNanchor_201_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_210" class="fnanchor">201</a>.</p>

<h2>NO. XXIV.&mdash;SAMARIA.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Samaria</span> is never called in Scripture Sebast,
though strangers know it only by that name.</p>

<p>Obadiah is supposed to have been buried in this
city; and here, at one time, were shown the tombs
of Elisha, and of John the Baptist; and many
ancient coins of this town are still preserved in the
cabinets of the curious.</p>

<p>Samaria, during a siege, was afflicted with a great
famine; and a very extraordinary occurrence is related
with respect to it<a name="FNanchor_202_211" id="FNanchor_202_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_211" class="fnanchor">202</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;24. And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad
king of Syria gathered all his host, and went
up, and besieged Samaria.</p>

<p>&#8220;25. And there was a great famine in Samaria;
and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass&#8217;s head was
sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part
of a cab of dove&#8217;s dung for five pieces of silver.</p>

<p>&#8220;26. And as the king of Israel was passing by
upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him, saying,
Help, my lord, O king.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;27. And he said, if the Lord do not help thee,
whence shall I help thee? out of the barn-floor, or
out of the wine-press?</p>

<p>&#8220;28. And the king said unto her, What aileth
thee? And she answered, This woman said unto
me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to-day, and
we will eat my son to-morrow.</p>

<p>&#8220;29. So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I
said unto her on the next day, Give thy son, that we
may eat him: and she hath hid her son.</p>

<p>&#8220;30. And it came to pass, when the king heard the
words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; and
he passed by upon the wall, and the people looked,
and, behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh.</p>

<p>&#8220;31. Then he said, God do so and more also to me,
if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand
on him this day.</p>

<p>&#8220;32. But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders
sat with him; and the king sent a man from before
him; but ere the messenger came to him, he said to
the elders, See how this son of a murderer hath sent
to take away mine head! look, when the messenger
cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the
door: is not the sound of his master&#8217;s feet behind
him?</p>

<p>&#8220;33. And while he yet talked with them, behold,
the messenger came down unto him: and he said,
Behold, this evil is of the Lord; what should I wait
for the Lord any longer?&#8221;</p>

<p>This was one of the cities of Palestine. The
country in which it is situated was at one time greatly
infested with lions. The inhabitants were always
at variance with their neighbours the Jews,&mdash;who
detested them. The Samaritans having built a
temple on Mount Gerizim, similar to that at Jerusalem,
insisting that Gerizim was the spot which God
had originally consecrated, the Jews never forgave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
them for so doing, either in precept or practice.
Their malice pursued them everywhere; they called
them rebels and apostates; and held them in such utter
detestation, that to say,&mdash;&#8220;There goes a Samaritan,&#8221;
was a phrase equivalent to that of &#8220;There goes a
serpent.&#8221; This hatred was returned with nearly
equal force by the Samaritans; insomuch, that when
the Jews were building their temple, they did all
they could to prevent the execution of it.</p>

<p>When Alexander marched into Judæa, and had
arrived at Jerusalem, the Samaritans sent a number
of deputies, with great pomp and ceremony, to request
that he would visit the temple they had erected
on Mount Gerizim. As they had submitted to Alexander,
and assisted him with troops, they naturally
thought that they deserved as much favour from him
as the Jews; and, indeed, more. Alexander, however,
does not appear to have thought so; for when the deputies
were introduced, he thanked them, indeed, in a
courteous manner, but he declined visiting their temple;
giving them to understand, that his affairs were
urgent, and, therefore, that he had not sufficient time;
but that if he should return that way from Egypt,
he would not fail to do as they desired; that is, if he
had time. The Samaritans afterwards mutinied; in
consequence of which Alexander drove them out of
Samaria; for they had set fire to the house of the
governor he had appointed, and burned him alive.
He divided their lands amongst the Jews, and repeopled
their city with a colony of Macedonians.</p>

<p>When Antiochus afterwards marched into their
country, they had the baseness to send a petition to
that monarch, in which they declared themselves not
to be Jews; in confirmation of which they entreated,
that the temple, they had built upon Mount Gerizim,
might be dedicated to the Jupiter of Greece. This
petition was received with favour; and the temple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
was, therefore, dedicated as the Samaritans had
petitioned.</p>

<p>This city was afterwards subject to the vengeance
of Hyrcanus, son of Simon, one of the Maccabees.
It stood a siege for nearly a year. When the conqueror
took it, he ordered it to be immediately demolished.
The walls of the city, and the houses of
the inhabitants, were entirely razed and laid level
with the ground; and, to prevent its ever being rebuilt,
he caused deep trenches and ditches to be cut
through the new plain, where the city had stood,
into which water was turned<a name="FNanchor_203_212" id="FNanchor_203_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_212" class="fnanchor">203</a>.</p>

<p>Thus it remained till the time of Herod, who rebuilt
the city; and, in honour of Augustus, gave it
the name of Sebastos<a name="FNanchor_204_213" id="FNanchor_204_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_213" class="fnanchor">204</a>.</p>

<h2>NO. XXV.&mdash;SAPPHURA.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> village was once the chief city and bulwark
of Galilee. Its inhabitants often revolted against the
Romans; but few remains of its ancient greatness
now exist. There are, however, ruins of a stately
Gothic edifice, which some travellers esteem one of
the finest structures in the Holy Land. &#8220;We entered,&#8221;
says Dr. Clarke, &#8220;beneath lofty massive
arches of stone. The roof of the building was of
the same materials. The arches are placed in the
intersection of a Greek cross, and originally supported
a dome or tower; their appearance is highly
picturesque, and they exhibit the grandeur of a noble
style of architecture. Broken columns of granite
and marble lie scattered among the walls; and these
prove how richly it was decorated.&#8221; In this place
Dr. Clarke saw several very curious paintings.</p>

<p>This place was visited in the early part of the
seventeenth century by a Franciscan friar of Lodi,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>in Italy, named Quaresimius, who says:&mdash;&#8220;This place
now exhibits a scene of ruin and desolation, consisting
only of peasants&#8217; habitations, and sufficiently
manifests, in its remains, the splendour of the ancient
city. Considered as the native place of Joachim
and Anna, the parents of the Virgin, it is renowned,
and worthy of being visited.&#8221; &#8220;It is not easy,&#8221;
says Dr. Clarke, &#8220;to account for the disregard shown
to a monument of antiquity, highly interesting from
its title to consideration in the history of ancient
architecture, or to the city of which it was the pride,
once renowned as the metropolis of Galilee.&#8221;</p>

<p>The following account is from the pen of the celebrated
French traveller, M. La Martine:&mdash;&#8220;A great
number of blocks of stone, hollowed out for tombs,
traced our route to the summit of the mamelon,
on which Saphora is situated. Arrived at the top,
we beheld an insulated column of granite still standing,
and marking the site of a temple. Beautiful sculptured
capitals were lying on the ground at the foot
of the column, and immense fragments of hewn stone,
removed from some great Roman monument, were
scattered everywhere round, serving the Arabs as
boundaries to their property, and extending as far
as a mile from Saphora, where we stopped to halt
in the middle of the day.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is all that now remains of this once noble
city.</p>

<p>&#8220;A fountain of excellent and inexhaustible
water,&#8221; continues La Martine, &#8220;flows herefrom,
for the use of the inhabitants of two or three
valleys; it is surrounded by some orchards of fig and
pomegranate trees, under the shade of which we
seated ourselves; and waited more than an hour before
we could water our caravan, so numerous were the
herds of cows and camels which the Arabian shepherds
brought from all parts of the valley. Innumerable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
files of cattle and black goats wound across
the plain and the sides of the hill leading to Nazareth<a name="FNanchor_205_214" id="FNanchor_205_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_214" class="fnanchor">205</a>.&#8221;</p>

<h2>NO. XXVI.&mdash;SARDIS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Sardis</span> is thus alluded to in the Apocalypse<a name="FNanchor_206_215" id="FNanchor_206_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_215" class="fnanchor">206</a>:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;1. And unto the angel of the church in Sardis
write:&mdash;These things saith he that hath the seven
spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy
works, that thou hast a name, that thou livest, and
art dead.</p>

<p>&#8220;2. Be watchful and strengthen the things which
remain, that are ready to die; for I have not found
thy works perfect before God.</p>

<p>&#8220;3. Remember therefore how thou hast received and
heard, and hold fast and repent. If therefore thou
shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and
thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.</p>

<p>&#8220;4. Thou hast a few names even in Sardis, which
have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk
with me in white; for they are worthy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sardis was situated five hundred and forty stadia
from Ephesus; viz. seven miles and a half.</p>

<p>When this city was built is not, we believe, upon
record. It was the capital of Lydia, and situated on
the banks of the Pactolus, at the foot of Mount
Tmolus; having the Cayster to the south, and Hermus
to the north.</p>

<p>During the reign of Atys, son of Gyges, the Cimmerians,
being expelled their own country by the
Nomades of Scythia, passed over into Asia, and
possessed themselves of Sardis. Some time after
this, Cr&#339;sus became king of Lydia, and a war ensued
between him and Cyrus the Great. At that period
no nation of Asia was more hardy, or more valiant,
than the Lydians. They fought principally on horseback,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
armed with long spears, and were very expert
in managing the horse. Sardis, according to Herodotus,
was taken by storm; according to Polyænus,
by surprise. Cyrus availed himself of a truce, which
he had concluded with Cr&#339;sus, (the richest of kings),
to advance his forces, and making his approach by
night, took the city. Cr&#339;sus, still remaining in possession
of the citadel, expected the arrival of his
Grecian succours: but Cyrus, putting in irons the relatives
and friends of those who defended the citadel,
showed them in that state to the besieged. At the
same time he informed them by a herald, that, if
they would give up the place, he would set their
friends at liberty; but that, if they persevered in
their defence, he would put them to death. The besieged
chose rather to surrender, than cause their
relations to perish. Such is the relation of Polyænus.</p>

<p>The Persians obtained possession of Sardis, and
made Cr&#339;sus captive, after a siege of fourteen days,
and a reign of fourteen years. Thus was a mighty
empire destroyed in a few days. Cr&#339;sus being
brought into the presence of Cyrus, that prince
ordered him to be placed in chains upon the summit
of a huge wooden pile, with fourteen Lydian youths
standing round him. Before this, however, Cyrus
gave the citizens to understand, that if they would
bring to him and his army all their silver and gold,
their city should be spared. On learning this, they
brought to him all their wealth; but Cr&#339;sus was
ordered to be burned alive. Before we give an account
of this barbarous order, however, we must refer to a
circumstance which had occurred several years before.</p>

<p>Solon, one of the most celebrated of legislators,
having established a new system of laws at Athens,
thought to improve his knowledge by travel. He
went, therefore, to Sardis. The king received him
very sumptuously;&mdash;dressed in magnificent apparel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
enriched with gold, and glittering with diamonds.
Finding that the Grecian sage did not appear in any
way moved by this display, Cr&#339;sus ordered, that all
his treasures, royal apartments, and costly furniture,
should be shown to him. When Solon had been
shown all these, he was taken back to the king, who
then inquired of him:&mdash;Which of all the persons
he had seen during his travels, he esteemed the most
happy? &#8220;A person named Tellus,&#8221; answered Solon,
&#8220;a citizen of Athens; an honest and good man; one
who had lived all his days without indigence, and
always seen his country flourishing and happy; who
had children that were universally esteemed; and
whose children he had the satisfaction, also, of seeing,
and who died at last gloriously fighting for his country.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Cr&#339;sus heard this, thinking that if he
were not esteemed the first in happiness, he would at
least be thought the second, he inquired &#8220;Who, of
all you have seen, was the next in happiness to Tellus?&#8221;
&#8220;Cleobis and Biton of Argos,&#8221; answered Solon, &#8220;two
brothers who left behind them a perfect pattern of
fraternal affection, and of the respect due from children
to their parents. Upon a solemn festival when
their mother, a priestess of Juno, was to go to the
temple, the oxen that were to draw her not being
ready, the two sons put themselves to the yoke, and
drew their mother&#8217;s chariot thither, which was above
five miles distant. All the mothers, ravished with
admiration, congratulated the priestess on the piety
of her sons. She, in the transport of her joy and
thankfulness, earnestly entreated the goddess to
reward her children with the best thing that heaven
can give to man. Her prayers were heard. When
the sacrifice was over, her two sons fell asleep in
the very temple to which they had brought her,
and there died in a soft and peaceful slumber. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
honour of their piety,&#8221; concluded Solon, &#8220;the people
of Argos consecrated statues to them in the temple
of Delphos.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cr&#339;sus was greatly mortified at this answer; and
therefore said with some token of discontent, &#8220;Then
you do not reckon me in the number of the happy at
all?&#8221; &#8220;King of Lydia,&#8221; answered Solon, &#8220;besides
many other advantages, the gods have given to us
Grecians a spirit of moderation and reserve, which
has produced among us a plain, popular, kind of philosophy,
accompanied with a certain generous freedom,
void of pride and ostentation, and therefore not
well suited to the courts of kings. This philosophy,
considering what an infinite number of vicissitudes
and accidents the life of man is liable to, does not allow
us to glory in any prospects we enjoy ourselves, or
to admire happiness in others which may prove only
superficial and transient.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having said this much, Solon paused a little,&mdash;then
proceeded to say, that &#8220;the life of man seldom exceeds
seventy years, which make up in all twenty-five
thousand five hundred and fifty days, of which two are
not exactly alike; so that the time to come is nothing
but a series of various accidents, which cannot be foreseen.
Therefore, in our opinion,&#8221; continued Solon, &#8220;no
man can be esteemed happy, but he whose happiness
God continues to the end of his life. As for
others, who are perpetually exposed to a thousand
dangers, we account their happiness as uncertain, as
the crown is to a person that is still engaged in battle,
and has not yet obtained the victory.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not long before Cr&#339;sus experienced the
truth of what Solon told him. Cyrus made war
upon him, as we have already related: and he was now
condemned to be burned. The funeral pile was prepared,
and the unhappy king being laid thereon, and
just on the point of execution, recollecting the conversation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
he had had with Solon some few years
before, he cried aloud three times, &#8220;Solon! Solon!
Solon!&#8221; When Cyrus heard him exclaim thus, he became
curious to know why Cr&#339;sus pronounced that
celebrated sage&#8217;s name with so much earnestness in
the extremity to which he was reduced. Cr&#339;sus
informed him. The conqueror instantly paused in
the punishment designed; and, reflecting on the uncertain
state to which all sublunary things are subject,
he caused him to be taken from the pile, and ever
afterwards treated him with honour and respect.
This account is from Rollin, who has it from Herodotus
and other ancient writers.</p>

<p>Cr&#339;sus is honourably mentioned by Pindar, in his
celebrated contrast between a good sovereign and a
bad one:&mdash;</p>

<p>On the division of the Persian monarchy into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>satrapies, Sardis became the residence of the satrap
who had the government of the sea-coast.</p>

<p>In the third year of the war arising from the
revolt of the Ionians against the Persian authority,
the Ionians having collected all their forces together,
set sail for Ephesus, whence, leaving their ships,
they marched by land to Sardis. Finding that city
in a defenceless state, they made themselves masters
of it; but the citadel, into which the Persian governor
Artaphernes had retired, they were not able
to force. Most of the houses were roofed with reeds.
An Ionian soldier therefore having, whether with
intention or by accident was never ascertained, set
fire to a house, the flames flew from roof to roof, and
the whole city was entirely destroyed, almost in a
moment. In this destruction the Persians implicated
the Athenians; for there were many Athenians
among the Ionians. When Darius, therefore, heard
of the conflagration, he immediately determined on
making war upon Greece; and that he might never
forget the resolution, he appointed an officer to the
duty of crying out to him every night at supper,&mdash;&#8220;Sir,
remember the Athenians.&#8221; It is here, also, to
be remembered, that the cause why the Persians
afterwards destroyed all the temples they came near
in Greece, was in consequence of the temple of Cybele,
the tutelary deity of Sardis, having been, at that
period, reduced to ashes.</p>

<p>Xerxes, on his celebrated expedition, having
arrived at Sardis, sent heralds into Greece, demanding
earth and water. He did not, however, send
either to Athens or Lacedæmon. His motive for
enforcing his demand to the other cities, was the
expectation that they, who had before refused earth
and water to Darius, would, from the alarm at his
approach, send it now. In this, however, he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
for the most part mistaken. Xerxes wintered at this
city.</p>

<p>Alexander having conquered the Persians at the
battle of the Granicus, marched towards Sardis. It
was the bulwark of the Persian empire on the side
next the sea. The citizens surrendered; and, as a
reward for so doing, the king gave them their liberties,
and permitted them to live under their own laws.
He gave orders, also, to the Sardians to erect a
temple to Olympian Jove.</p>

<p>After the death of Alexander, Seleucus, carrying
on a war with Lysimachus, took possession of Sardis,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span> 283. In 214 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span> Antiochus the Great made
himself master of the citadel and city. He kept
possession of it twenty-five years, and it became his
favourite place of retreat after having lost the battle
of Magnesia. His taking it is thus described by
Polybius:&mdash;&#8220;An officer had observed, that vultures
and birds of prey gathered round the rock on which
the citadel was placed, about the offals and dead
bodies, thrown into a hollow by the besieged; and
inferred that the wall standing on the edge of the
precipice was neglected, as secure from attack. He
scaled it with a resolute party, while Antiochus called
off the attention both of his own army and of the
enemy by a feint, marching as if he intended to
attack the Persian gate. Two thousand soldiers
rushed in at the gate opened for them, and took their
post at the theatre, when the town was plundered
and burned.&#8221;</p>

<p>Attalus Philomater, one of the descendants of the
Antiochus just mentioned, bequeathed Sardis, with
all his other possessions, to the Roman people; and,
three years after his death, it was in consequence
reduced to a Roman province.</p>

<p>Under the reign of Tiberius, Sardis was a very
large city; but it was almost wholly destroyed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
an earthquake. The emperor, however, had sufficient
public virtue to order it to be rebuilt, and at a
very great expense. In this patronage of Sardis, he
was imitated by Hadrian, who was so great a benefactor,
that he obtained the name of Neocorus. The
patron god was Jupiter, who was called by a name
synonymous with protector.</p>

<p>Sardis was one of the first towns that embraced
the Christian religion, having been converted by St.
John; and some have thought that its first bishop
was Clement, the disciple of St. Paul.</p>

<p>In the time of Julian great efforts were made to restore
the Pagan worship, by erecting temporary altars
at Sardis, where none had been left, and repairing
those temples of which vestiges remained.</p>

<p>A. D. 400, the city was plundered by the Goths,
under Tribigildus and Cairanas, officers in the Roman
pay, who had revolted from the emperor Arcadius.</p>

<p>A. D. 1304, the Turks, on an insurrection of the
Tartars, were permitted to occupy a portion of the
Acropolis; but the Sardians, on the same night,
murdered them in their sleep.</p>

<p>The town is now called Sart or Serte. When
Dr. Chandler visited it in 1774, he found the site
of it &#8220;green and flowery.&#8221; Coming from the east, he
found on his left the ground-work of a theatre;
of which still remained some pieces of the vault,
which supported the seats, and completed the semicircle.</p>

<p>Going on, he passed remnants of massy buildings;
marble piers sustaining heavy fragments of arches of
brick, and more indistinct ruins. These are in the
plain before the hill of the Acropolis. On the right
hand, near the road, was a portion of a large edifice,
with a heap of ponderous materials before and behind
it. The walls also are standing of two large,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
long, and lofty rooms, with a space between them,
as of a passage. This remnant, according to M. Peysonell,
was the house of Cr&#339;sus, once appropriated
by the Sardians as a place of retirement for superannuated
citizens. The walls in this ruin have
double arches beneath, and consist chiefly of brick,
with layers of stone: it is called the Gerusia. The
bricks are exceedingly fine and good, of various sizes,
some flat and broad. &#8220;We employed,&#8221; continues
Dr. Chandler, &#8220;a man to procure one entire, but
the cement proved so very hard and tenacious, it
was next to impossible. Both Cr&#339;sus and Mausolus,
neither of whom could be accused of parsimony,
had used this material in the walls of their palaces.
It was insensible of decay; and it is asserted, if the
walls were erected true to their perpendicular, would,
without violence, last for ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>Our traveller was then led toward the mountain;
when, on a turning of the road, he was struck with
the view of a ruin of a temple, in a retired situation
beyond the Pactolus, and between Mount Tmolus
and the hill of the Acropolis. Five columns were
standing, one without the capital, and one with the
capital awry, to the south. The architrave was of
two stones. A piece remains of one column, to
the southward; the other part, with the column
which contributed to its support, has fallen since the
year 1699. One capital was then distorted, as was
imagined, by an earthquake; and over the entrance
of the Naos was a vast stone, which occasioned
wonder by what art or power it could be raised.
That magnificent portal has since been destroyed;
and in the heap lies that huge and ponderous marble.
The soil has accumulated round the ruin; and the
bases, with a moiety of each column, are concealed.
This, in the opinion of Dr. Chandler, is probably the
Temple of Cybele; and which was damaged in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
conflagration of Sardis by the Milesians. It was
of the Ionic order, and had eight columns in front.
The shafts are fluted, and the capitals designed with
exquisite taste and skill. &#8220;It is impossible,&#8221; continues
our traveller, &#8220;to behold without deep regret,
this imperfect remnant of so beautiful and so glorious
an edifice!&#8221;</p>

<p>In allusion to this, Wheler, who visited Sart towards
the latter part of the seventeenth century,
says:&mdash;&#8220;Now see how it fareth with this miserable
church, marked out by God; who, being reduced to
a very inconsiderable number, live by the sweat of
their brows in digging and planting the gardens
of the Turks they live amongst and serve; having
neither church nor priest among them. Nor are the
Turks themselves there very considerable, either for
number or riches; being only herdsmen to cattle
feeding on those spacious plains; dwelling in a few
pitiful earthen huts; having one mosque, perverted
to that use from a Christian church. Thus is that
once glorious city of the rich king Cr&#339;sus now
reduced to a nest of worse than beggars. Their
Pactolus hath long since ceased to yield them gold,<a name="FNanchor_208_217" id="FNanchor_208_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_217" class="fnanchor">208</a>
and the treasures to recover them their dying glories.
Yet there are some remains of noble structures, remembrances
of their prosperous state, long since
destroyed. For there are the remains of an old
castle, of a great church, palaces, and other proud
buildings, humbled to the earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Several inscriptions have been found here; and,
amongst these, one recording the good will of the
council and senate of Sardis towards the emperor
Antoninus Pius. Medals, too, have been found;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>amongst which, two very rare ones; viz. one of the
Empress Tranquillina, and another of Caracalla, with
an urn on the reverse, containing a branch of olives;
under which is an inscription, which translated,
is, &#8220;<i>The sport Chysanthina of the Sardians twice
Nercorus</i>.&#8221; Another, stamped by the common assembly
of Asia there, in honour of Drusus and Germanicus.
Also one with the Emperor Commodus,
seated in the midst of a zodiac, with celestial signs
engraved on it: on the reverse, &#8220;<i>Sardis, the first
metropolis of Asia, Greece, Lydia</i>.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_209_218" id="FNanchor_209_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_218" class="fnanchor">209</a></p>

<h2>NO. XXVII.&mdash;SELEUCIA.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were no less than thirteen cities, which
were called Seleucia, and which received their name
from Seleucus Nicanor. These were situated in Syria,
in Cilicia, and near the Euphrates.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be acknowledged,&#8221; says Dr. Prideaux,
&#8220;that there is mention made of Babylon, as of a city
standing long after the time I have placed its dissolution,
as in Lucan<a name="FNanchor_210_219" id="FNanchor_210_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_219" class="fnanchor">210</a>, Philostratus<a name="FNanchor_211_220" id="FNanchor_211_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_220" class="fnanchor">211</a>, and others. But
in all those authors, and wherever also we find Babylon
mentioned as a city in being, after the time of
Seleucus Nicanor, it must be understood, not of old
Babylon, on the Euphrates, but of Seleucia, on the
Tigris. For as that succeeded to the dignity and
grandeur of old Babylon, so also did it in its
name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since the days of Alexander,&#8221; says Sir R. Porter,
&#8220;we find four capitals, at least, built out of the remains
of Babylon; Seleucia by the Greeks; Ctesiphon by
the Parthians; Al Maidan by the Persians; Kufa by
the Caliphs; with towns, villages, and caravanserais,
without number. That the fragments of one city
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>should travel so far, to build or repair the breaches
of another, appeared, on the first view of the subject,
to be unlikely to myself; but, on traversing the
country between the approximating shores of the
two rivers, and observing all the facilities of water-carriage
from one side to the other, I could no longer
be incredulous of what had been told me; particularly
when scarce a day passed without my seeing
people digging the mounds of Babylon for bricks,
which they carried to the verge of the Euphrates,
and thence conveyed in boats to wherever they
might be wanted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Seleucus built many cities; of which far the
greater part was raised from superstitious motives;
many were peopled from the ruins of places in
their neighbourhood, whose sites were equally convenient;
and only a very few were erected in conformity
with those great military and commercial views, by
which, in this particular, his master (Alexander)
had uniformly been guided. He named nine after
himself; and four in honour of four of his wives;
three Apameas; and one Stratonice; in all thirty-five.
Sixteen were named Antioch; five Laodicea,
after his mother. Many foundations were laid of
other cities. Some, after favourite scenes in Greece
or Macedon; some in memory of glorious exploits;
and not a few after his master Alexander.</p>

<p>This Seleucia was built of the ruins of Babylon;
and Pliny, the naturalist, gives the following account:&mdash;&#8220;Seleucia
was built by Seleucus Nicanor, forty
miles from Babylon, at a point of the confluence of
the Euphrates with the Tigris, by a canal. There
were 600,000 citizens here at one time; and all the
commerce and wealth of Babylon had flowed into it.
The territory in which it stood was called Babylonia;
but it was itself a free state, and the people
lived after the laws and manners of the Macedonians.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
The form of the walls resembled an eagle spreading
her wings.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a country, destitute of wood and stone, whose
edifices were hastily erected with bricks baked
in the sun, and cemented with the native bitumen,
Seleucia speedily eclipsed the ancient capital of the
East.</p>

<p>Many ages after the fall of the Macedonian empire,
Seleucia retained the genuine character of a
Greek colony; arts, military virtue, and a love of
freedom: and while the republic remained independent,
it was governed by a senate consisting of
three hundred nobles. The walls were strong; and
as long as concord prevailed among the several orders
of the state, the power of the Parthians was regarded
with indifference, if not with contempt. The madness
of faction, however, was sometimes so great,
that the common enemy was occasionally implored;
and the Parthians<a name="FNanchor_212_221" id="FNanchor_212_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_221" class="fnanchor">212</a> were, in consequence, beheld
at the gates, to assist sometimes one party, and
sometimes the other. Ctesiphon was then but a
village<a name="FNanchor_213_222" id="FNanchor_213_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_222" class="fnanchor">213</a>, on the opposite side of the Tigris, in which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>the Parthian kings were accustomed to reside during
the winter, on account of the mildness of the climate.
The summer they passed at Ecbatana.</p>

<p>Trajan left Rome <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 112, and after subduing
several cities in the East, laid siege to Seleucia and
Ctesiphon. Chosroes, the king, being absent quelling
a revolt in some part of his more eastern dominions,
these cities soon surrendered to the Roman hero, and
all the neighbouring country. &#8220;The degenerate
Parthians,&#8221; says the Roman historian, &#8220;broken by
internal discord, fled before his arms. He descended
the Tigris in triumph from the mountains of Armenia
to the Persian gulf. He enjoyed the honour of
being the first, as he was the last, of the Roman
generals who ever navigated that remote sea.&#8221; At
his death, which occurred soon after his return to
Rome, most of the cities of Asia, that he had conquered,
threw off the Roman yoke; and among these
were Seleucia and Ctesiphon.</p>

<p>Under the reign of Marcus, <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 165, the Roman
generals penetrated as far as these celebrated cities.
They were received as friends by the Greek colony;
they attacked, as enemies, the seat of the Parthian
kings; and yet both experienced the same treatment.
Seleucia was sacked by the friends they had invited&mdash;though
it has been alleged in their favour, that the
citizens of Seleucia had first violated their faith.</p>

<p>More than 300,000 of the inhabitants were put to
the sword; and the city itself nearly destroyed by
conflagration.</p>

<p>Seleucia never recovered this blow: but Ctesiphon,
in about thirty-three years, had sufficiently recovered
its strength to maintain an obstinate siege against the
emperor Severus. It was at last, nevertheless, taken
by assault; and the king, who defended it in person,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>escaped with precipitation. The Romans netted a
rich booty, and took captive 100,000 persons<a name="FNanchor_214_223" id="FNanchor_214_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_223" class="fnanchor">214</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Below Bagdad,&#8221; says a celebrated French writer,
on geography, (Malte-Brun), &#8220;the ruins of Al-Modain,
or the two cities, have attracted the attention
of every traveller. One of them is unquestionably
the ancient Ctesiphon; but the other, which
lies on the western bank of the Tigris, is not Seleucia,
as all the travellers affirm<a name="FNanchor_215_224" id="FNanchor_215_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_224" class="fnanchor">215</a>: it is Kochos, a fortress
situated opposite to Seleucia, and which, according to
the positive testimony of Arrian and Gregory of
Nazianzus, was different from Seleucia<a name="FNanchor_216_225" id="FNanchor_216_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_225" class="fnanchor">216</a>.&#8221; In this
account Malte-Brun appears to us to be exceedingly
mistaken<a name="FNanchor_217_226" id="FNanchor_217_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_226" class="fnanchor">217</a>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Of the ruins of <span class="smcap">Seleucia</span>, near <span class="smcap">Antioch</span>, Mr.
Robinson speaks thus:&mdash;&#8220;Being desirous of visiting
the ruins of the ancient Seleucia Pieriæ, I rode over to
the village of Kepse, occupying the site of the ancient
city. We were apprised of our approach to it, by
seeing a number of sepulchral grots excavated in
the rock by the road-side, at present tenanted by
shepherds and their flocks. Some were arched like
those I had seen at Delphi; others were larger, with
apartments, one within the other. We entered the
inclosure of the ancient city by the gate at the south-east
side; probably the one that led to Antioch. It
is defended by round towers, at present in ruins. Of
the magnificent temples and buildings mentioned
by Polybius, some remains of pillars are alone standing
to gratify the curiosity of the antiquarian traveller.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
But recollecting, as I sat alone on a stone seat
at the jetty head, that it was from hence Paul and
Barnabas, the harbingers of Christianity to the West,
when sent forth from the church at Antioch, embarked
for Cyprus; the place all at once assumed an
interest that heathen relics were little calculated to
inspire. It came opportunely, also, for I felt particularly
depressed at the sight of a large maritime city,
once echoing with the voices of thousands, now without
an inhabitant; a port formerly containing rich
laden galleys, at present choked up with reeds; and
finally, a quay, on which for centuries anxious mariners
paced up and down throughout the day, at this
moment without a living creature moving on its
weather-beaten surface but myself.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<h2>NO. XXVIII.&mdash;SELINUS, OR SELINUNTUM.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> city was founded <span class="smcap lowercase">A. U. C.</span> 127, by a colony
from Megara. It received its name from a Greek
word meaning parsley, which grew there in great
profusion; and its ancient consequence may be
learned from the ruins now remaining. It was
destroyed by Hannibal. The conduct of the war
having been committed to that general, he set sail
with a very large fleet and army. He landed at a
place called the Well of Lilybæum, which gave its
name to a city afterwards built on the same spot.</p>

<p>His first enterprise was the siege of Selinuntum.
The attack and defence were equally vigorous; the
very women showing a resolution and bravery beyond
their sex. The city, after making a long
resistance, was taken by storm, and the plunder of it
abandoned to the soldiers. The victor exercised the
most horrid cruelties, without showing the least
regard to age or sex. He permitted, however, such
inhabitants as had fled to continue in the city after it
had been dismantled, and to till the lands, on condition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
of their paying a tribute to the Carthaginians.
The city had then been built 242 years.
It became afterwards an important place; but from
the manner in which the columns and other fragments
of three stupendous temples lie, it is quite evident
they must have been thrown down by an earthquake;
but the date of that calamity is not known.</p>

<p>The ruins of Selinus are thus described by Mr. Swinburne:&mdash;&#8220;They
lie in several stupendous heaps, with
many columns still erect, and at a distance resemble
a large town with a crowd of steeples. On the top
of the hill is a very extensive level, seven miles off,
on which lie the scattered members of three Doric
temples, thirty yards asunder, in a direct line from
north to south. The most northerly temple, which
was pseudodipterous, exceeded the others very much
in dimensions and majesty, and now composes one
of the most gigantic and sublime ruins imaginable.
They all lie in great confusion and disorder.</p>

<p>&#8220;The second temple is easily described. It had six
columns in the front, and eleven on each side; in
all thirty-four. Their diameter is five feet; they
were all fluted; and most of them now remain
standing as high as the second course of stones. The
pillars of the third temple were also fluted, and have
fallen down so very entire, that the five pieces which
composed them lie almost close to each other, in the
order they were placed in when upright. These
temples are all of the Doric order, without a base.</p>

<p>&#8220;The two lesser ones are more delicate in their parts
and ornaments than the principal ruins; the stone of
which they are composed is smooth and yellowish, and
brought from the quarries of Castel-Franco. There
are other ruins and broken columns dispersed over
the site of the city, but none equal to these.&#8221; Such
is the account given by Mr. Swinburne; what follows
first appeared in the Penny Magazine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span></p>

<p>On the southern coast of Sicily, about ten miles
to the east of Cape Granitola, and between the little
rivers of Maduini and Bilici, (the Crimisus and Hypsa
of ancient times,) a tremendous mass of ruins presents
itself in the midst of a solitary and desolate
country. These are the sad remains of the once splendid
city of Selinus, or Selinuntum, which was founded
by a Greek colony from Megara, more than two thousand
four hundred years ago. When seen at a distance
from the sea, they still look like a mighty city; but
on a near approach nothing is seen but a confused
heap of fallen edifices&mdash;a mixture of broken shafts,
capitals, entablatures, and metopæ, with a few truncated
columns erect among them. They seem to
consist chiefly of the remains of three temples of the
Doric order. One of these temples was naturally
devoted by a maritime and trading people to Neptune;
a second was dedicated to Castor and Pollux, the
friends of navigation and the scourge of pirates; the
destination of the third temple is uncertain.</p>

<p>The size of the columns and the masses of stone that
lie heaped about them is prodigious. The lower circumference
of the columns is thirty-one feet and a half;
many of the stone blocks measure twenty-five feet in
length, eight in height, and six in thickness. Twelve
of the columns have fallen with singular regularity, the
disjointed shaft-pieces of each lying in a straight line
with the base from which they fell, and having their
several capitals at the other end of the line. If architects
and antiquaries have not been mistaken in their
task of measuring among heaps of ruins that in good
part cover and conceal the exterior lines, the largest
of the three temples was three hundred and thirty-four
feet long, and one hundred and fifty-four feet
wide.</p>

<p>These are prodigious and unusual dimensions for
ancient edifices of this kind. That wonder of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
whole world, the Temple of Diana at Ephesus, itself
did not much exceed these admeasurements. The
great Selinuntian temple seems to have had porticoes
of four columns in depth, and eight in width, with a
double row of sixteen columns on the lateral sides of
the cella. It is somewhat singular, from having had
all the columns of the first row on the east front fluted,
while all the rest of the columns were quite plain.
One of these fluted columns is erect and tolerably entire,
with the exception of its capital. The fluting,
moreover, is not in the Doric style; for each flute is
separated by a fillet. The material of which this and
the other edifices were formed, is a species of fine-grained
petrifaction, hard, and very sonorous on being
struck with a hammer. It was hewn out of quarries
near at hand, at a place called Campo Bello, where
many masses, only partially separated from the rock,
and looking as if the excavation had been suddenly
interrupted, are still seen.</p>

<p>A flight of ancient steps, in tolerable preservation,
leads from the Marinella to the Acropolis, where the
covert-ways, gates, and walls, built of large squared
stones, may still be traced all round the hill. A little
to the west of the Acropolis is the small pestiferous
lake, Yhalici, partly choked up with sand. In ancient
times this was called <i>Stagnum Gonusa</i>, and it is
said the great philosopher Empedocles purified it and
made the air around it wholesome, by clearing a mouth
towards the sea, and conveying a good stream of water
through it. The Fountain of Diana, at a short distance,
which supplied this stream, still pours forth a
copious volume of excellent water; but it is allowed
to run and stagnate over the plain, and now adds to
the <i>malaria</i> created by the stagnant lake. The
surrounding country is wholly uncultivated, and,
where not a morass, is covered with underwood, dwarf
palms, and myrtle-bushes of a prodigious growth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span></p>

<p>For six months in the year, Selinunte is a most unhealthy
place; and though the stranger may visit it
by day-time without much danger of catching the
infection, it seems scarcely possible to sleep there in
summer and escape the malaria fever in one of its
worst forms. Of four English artists who tried the
experiment in 1822, not one escaped; and Mr. Harris,
a young architect of great promise, died in Sicily
from the consequences. These gentlemen made a discovery
of some importance. They dug up near one
of the temples some sculptured metopæ with figures
in rilievo, of a singular primitive style, which seems
to have more affinity with the Egyptian or the Etruscan,
than with the Greek style of a later age. There
are probably few Greek fragments of so ancient a
date in so perfect a state of preservation.</p>

<p>The government claimed these treasures, and caused
them to be transported to Palermo; but Mr. Samuel
Angel, an architect, and one of the party, took casts
from them, which may now be seen at the British
Museum; and of which we present the reader with
an account, drawn up, we believe, by a gentleman
named Hamilton.&mdash;&#8220;Within a temporary building
opening from the fifth room, are the casts from
the marble metopæ of the great temple of Jupiter
Olympius, at Selinus, in Sicily. Valuable as they
are, as belonging to a school of art prior to that
of &AElig;gina, and probably of a date coeval with the
earliest Egyptian, a short notice of them may not
be unacceptable, as no account of them is to be
found in the Synopsis, although to the public in general
subjects of great curiosity and inquiry. The legend
which they tell and their appearance, are altogether
as unaccountable as mysterious. At Selinus,
in Sicily, there are the remains of six temples of the
earliest Doric, within a short distance of each other,
and it was during the researches into the ruins of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
largest, called the Western, and the one farthest from
it, named the Eastern, by Messrs. Harris and Angell,
in 1832, that these ancient sculptures were found:
among them there were no single and perfect statues
as in the temple of &AElig;gina, which probably arose
from the neighbourhood being well peopled, and they
had no doubt been repeatedly ransacked. These temples
may be reckoned among the largest of antiquity,
being equal in their dimensions to those at Agrigentum,
in the fluting of whose columns there is sufficient
space for a man to stand. Immediately after the
discovery, application was made to the Neapolitan
Government to allow them to be shipped for England;
but permission was refused, and they are now in the
Royal Gallery at Palermo. Casts were, however,
allowed to be taken, and they are these we now
describe.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are probably of as early a date as any that
have reached our times, and are of different styles of
art; those which belonged to the temple called Eastern,
whence the sculpture of the head of the dying
warrior, and the chariot drawn by horses, were taken,
possess much of the &AElig;ginitan character; those of
the Western are of a ruder age. In most of the figures
the anatomy resembles that of the earliest coins, but
differs in many respects from the Greek sculptures;
and there is a short and full character in the faces approaching
the Egyptian. From the short proportions,
the fleshy part of the thigh overcharged, and the peculiar
manner in which the hair is arranged, they might
be taken for specimens of &AElig;ginitan art; but on a
close inspection it will be found, that they are the
work of artists educated on different principles. At
a much later period it is known that the artists of
&AElig;gina were employed by the kings of Sicily; and
these, therefore, are not unlikely to have been the
work of Carthaginian sculptors brought to decorate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
a city in alliance and newly founded, which will account
for the Egyptian character given to the whole.</p>

<p>&#8220;The cast, which consists of the body and head of a
dying soldier, a part of a female figure behind, formed
the third metope of the Eastern Temple, and is a most
valuable and curious fragment, and determines the
style and character of the sculpture of the temple.
It bears a marked resemblance to some of the heads
in the &AElig;gina marbles, but it has much more expression;
the artist has evidently intended to mark the
agonies of death, by the closed eyes, the mouth
slightly opened, and the tongue appearing between
the teeth; the hair and beard are most carefully and
symmetrically arranged and most elaborately finished;
the helmet is thrown back, and is of the kind called
&#8216;&#947;&#949;&#8150;&#963;&#959;&#957;&#8217;&mdash;part of the crest &#8216;&#955;&#8057;&#966;&#959;&#962;&#8217; is visible under
the left shoulder of the figure. The fragment of the
female is very spirited, and evidently in strong action.
Those metopes, like those of the Parthenon, are in
high relief, and in some parts detached. Thorwaldsen
has pronounced them equal in execution to the
&AElig;gina. The next, which consists of three figures,
one of which has a horse under the arm, is particularly
interesting, from the illustration it presents of
the death of the Gorgon Medusa. Perseus, emboldened
by the presence of Minerva, is represented in
the act of slaying Medusa; his eyes are averted from
the object of his honour, while his right arm, guided
by the goddess, thrusts his sword into the throat of
the monster. Pegasus, a winged foal, springs from
her blood, and Medusa presses him to her side with
apparent solicitude. The monstrous face of the
Gorgon is finely represented; the large round head
and hideous face rise from the shoulders without the
intervention of a neck; all the features are frightfully
distorted, the nose is flat and spreading, and
the mouth is nearly the whole width of the face, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
is armed on each side with two immense tusks; the
hair over the forehead is curiously shown, and almost
appears to have represented the serpents to
which it was changed. The figure of Minerva on
the right is draped with the &#8216;&#960;&#8051;&#960;&#955;&#959;&#957;,&#8217; and has the
Mæander ornament on the edge. The figure of
Perseus is in the centre; he is armed with the
harp of Mercury and the helmet of Pluto, which
latter has a pendant falling on each side; the
&#8216;&#960;&#964;&#951;&#957;&#8048; &#960;&#8051;&#948;&#953;&#955;&#945;,&#8217; or <i>talaria</i>, are represented as covering
the feet entirely, and bear some resemblance
to the ancient greaves; the front part is attached to
the ancle by thongs. The form of the young Pegasus
is exceedingly beautiful; he seems bounding from the
earth. The metope, containing the figure bearing
two others on its shoulders, represents the adventure
of Hercules, surnamed Melampyges, from the black
and hairy appearance of his loins. The story is as
follows:&mdash;Passalus and Achemon, two brothers,
reviled their mother, who warned them to beware of
a man whose loins were covered with black hair.
They attempted to rob Hercules while asleep, and
from that had the name of Cercopes; in the attempt
they failed and awoke him, and he bound them hand
and foot to his bow, with their heads downwards,
and carried them in that manner. They began laughing
on the accomplishment of their mother&#8217;s prophecy;
Hercules asked them why they laughed, and on their
telling him the reason, he also laughed and liberated
them. The figure of the god is represented as strong
and muscular, and the two prisoners have a very
ludicrous appearance; in the reversed position, the
hair falls in a curious manner; the whole group has
been painted in various colours, and in the countenances
much of Egyptian expression is to be observed.
The horses which draw the chariot formed part of
the centre metope of the Eastern Temple; it is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
imperfect, and is supposed to represent the celebration
of the race of Pelops and &#338;nomaus; they are drawn
full of fire and courage, and are finely fore-shortened;
they have the cropped ears and manes which are
observable in those of the Parthenon.</p>

<p>&#8220;These sculptures are valuable as specimens of
the third period of the art, the earliest of which is
probably the Hindoo; the great resemblance both
these and the Egyptian bear to that style is remarkable,
and gives warrant to suppose that it was the
original school. Of Hebrew sculpture there are no
remains; the command to form no graven images prevented
the art attaining the perfection which it reached
in the neighbouring country of Syria, and would seem
to confirm the account, that within the land of
Judea no statue bearing marks of great antiquity has
been discovered. The Egyptian, the Etruscan, the
Selinuntine, and the &AElig;gina schools, furnished the
models for the Grecian; and the careful observer has
it in his power, within the walls of the Museum, to
trace, step by step, the progress of the art; till it
attained its meridian splendour in the production of
those sculptures, whose dilapidated remains are there
preserved, and which the accumulated knowledge,
genius, labour, and talent of two thousand five hundred
years has never yet been able to surpass<a name="FNanchor_218_227" id="FNanchor_218_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_227" class="fnanchor">218</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span></p>
<p>The neighbouring country is interesting, as having
been the scene of many of the memorable events
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>recorded by the ancient historians. A few miles to
the west of the ruins, on the banks of a little river,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>that now, unless when swelled by the winter torrents,
creeps gently into the sea, was fought, amidst thunder,
lightning, and rain, one of the most celebrated
battles of ancient times, in which the &#8220;Immortal
Timoleon,&#8221; the liberator of Corinth, and the saviour
of Syracuse, gained a glorious victory over the
Carthaginian invaders. The events are preserved
in popular traditions; and the names of Mago,
Hamilcar, Hannibal, Agathocles, Dionysius, and
Timoleon, are common in the mouths of the country
people, though not unfrequently confused with one
another, and subjected to the same laughable mutilation
as the name of Castor and Selinute<a name="FNanchor_219_228" id="FNanchor_219_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_228" class="fnanchor">219</a>.</p>

<h2>NO. XXIX.&mdash;SICYON.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> most ancient kingdom of Greece was that of
Sicyon, the beginning of which is placed by Eusebius
1313 years before the first Olympiad. Its duration
is believed to have been about a thousand
years; during which period it is said to have had a
succession of kings, whose reigns were so equitable that
nothing of importance is recorded of them. It sent,
however, 3000 troops to the battle of Platea, and fifteen
ships to that of Salamis. It is now only a village.</p>

<p>Of these monarchs the most remarkable was
Sicyon, who is supposed to have built, though some
say he only enlarged, the metropolis of his kingdom,
and to have called it by his own name.</p>

<p>It became very powerful in the time of the
Achaian league, which it joined, at the persuasion of
Aratus, <span class="smcap lowercase">A. C.</span> 251. It was destroyed by Demetrius,
son of Antigonus, who afterwards rebuilt it, and
endeavoured to impose upon it the name of Demetrius;
but it soon sunk under its ancient and more
memorable appellation.</p>

<p>Sicyon was in great reputation for the arts, and
painting in particular; the true taste for which was
preserved there in all its ancient purity. It is even
said, that Apelles, who was then admired by all the
world, had been at Sicyon, where he frequented the
schools of two painters, to whom he gave a talent;
not for acquiring a perfection of the art from them,
but in order to obtain a share in their great reputation.
When Aratus had reinstated his city in its
former liberties, he destroyed all the pictures of the
tyrants; but when he came to that of Aristratus,
who reigned in the time of Philip, and whom the
painter had represented in the attitude of standing
in a triumphant chariot, he hesitated a long time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
whether he should deface it or not; for all the capital
disciples of Melanthus had contributed to the completion
of that piece; and it had even been touched
by the pencil of Apelles. This work was so inimitable
in its kind, that Aratus was enchanted with its
beauties; but his aversion to tyrants prevailed over
his admiration of the picture, and he accordingly
ordered it to be destroyed.</p>

<p>In the time of Pausanias, Sicyon was destroyed
by an earthquake. It was, nevertheless, not long
after, not only one of the noblest cities of Greece, on
account of its magnificent edifices, many of which
were built of marble, and ingenious workmen, but it
was a distinguished place when the Venetians were
masters of the Morea. The period, however, when
it fell from that eminence is unknown.</p>

<p>Sicyon<a name="FNanchor_220_229" id="FNanchor_220_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_229" class="fnanchor">220</a> was the school of the most celebrated
artists of antiquity, and was sumptuously decorated
with temples and statues. Pausanias enumerates
seventeen temples, a stadium, a theatre, two gymnasia,
an agora, a senate-house, and a temenos for
the Roman emperors, with many altars, monuments,
and numerous statues of ivory and gold, of marble,
of bronze, and of wood.</p>

<p>Its present condition, in respect to population, may
be, in a great measure, attributed to its having, about
twenty years before Sir George Wheler visited it,
been afflicted by the plague. &#8220;This final destruction,&#8221;
said one of the inhabitants, &#8220;is a judgment of
God upon the Turks for turning one of the Christian
churches into a mosque. The Vaywode fell down
dead upon the place, the first time he caused the Koran
to be read in it. This was followed by a plague, which,
in a short time, utterly destroyed the whole town;
and it could never afterwards be repeopled.&#8221;</p>

<p>So little is known<a name="FNanchor_221_230" id="FNanchor_221_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_230" class="fnanchor">221</a> concerning this ancient seat of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
Grecian power, that it is not possible to ascertain in
what period it dwindled from its pre-eminence to
become, what it is now, one of the most wretched
villages of the Peloponnesus. The remains of its
former magnificence are, however, still considerable,
and in some instances they exist in such a state of
preservation, that it is evident the buildings of the
city either survived the earthquakes said to have overwhelmed
them, or they must have been constructed
at some later period.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ruins of Sicyon,&#8221; says Mr. Dodwell, &#8220;still
retain some vestiges of ancient magnificence. Among
these a fine theatre, situate at the north-east foot of
the Acropolis; having seats in a perfect state. Near
it are some large masses of Roman brick walls, and
the remains of the gymnasium, supported by strong
walls of polygonal construction. There are several
dilapidated churches which, composed of ancient fragments,
are supposed to occupy the site of the temples.
Several fragments of the Doric order are observable
among them; also several inscriptions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In respect to the temple of Bacchus,&#8221; says Dr.
Clarke, &#8220;we can be at no loss for its name, although
nothing but the ground-plot now remains. It is distinctly
stated by Pausanias to have been the temple
of Bacchus, which was placed beyond the theatre to a
person coming from the citadel, and to this temple
were made those annual processions which took
place at night, and by the light of the torches, when
the Sicyonians brought hither the mystic images, called
Bacchus and Lysius, chanting their ancient hymns.&#8221;</p>

<p>The theatre is almost in its entire state; and although
the notes were made upon the spot, did not
enable Dr. Clarke to afford a description of its form
and dimensions equally copious with that already given
of the famous theatre of Polycletus in Eidausia; yet
this of Sicyon may be considered as surpassing every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
other in Greece, in the harmony of its proportions,
the costliness of the workmanship, the grandeur of
the coilon, and the stupendous nature of the prospect
presented to all those who were seated upon its
benches. If it were cleared of the rubbish about it,
and laid open to view, it would afford an astonishing
idea of the magnificence of a city, whose treasures
were so great, that its inhabitants ranked amongst
the most voluptuous and effeminate people of all
Greece. The stone-work is entirely of that massive
kind, which denotes a very high degree of antiquity.</p>

<p>The stadium<a name="FNanchor_222_231" id="FNanchor_222_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_231" class="fnanchor">222</a> is on the right hand of a person
facing the theatre, and it is undoubtedly the oldest
work remaining of all that belonged to the ancient
city. The walls exactly resemble those of Mycenæ
and Tiryns; we may, therefore, class it among the
examples of the Cyclopean masonry. It is, in other
respects, the most remarkable structure of the kind
existing; combining at once a natural and artificial
character. The persons by whom it was formed,
finding that the mountain whereon the coilon of the
theatre has been constructed, would not allow a sufficient
space for another oblong cavea of the length
requisite to complete a stadium, built upon an artificial
rampart reaching out into the plain, from the
mountain toward the sea; so that this front-work
resembles half a stadium thrust into the semi-circular
cavity of a theatre; the entrance to the area, included
between both, being formed with great taste and
effect at the two sides or extremities of the semicircle.
The ancient masonry appears in the front-work
so placed. The length of the whole area equals
two hundred and sixty-seven paces; the width of
the advanced bastion thirty-six paces; and its height
twenty-two feet six inches.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span></p>
<p>Besides these there are some few other antiquities,
but of too minute a kind to merit description.</p>

<p>Even her ruins<a name="FNanchor_223_232" id="FNanchor_223_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_232" class="fnanchor">223</a> speak less emphatically of the
melancholy fate of Greece than her extensive solitudes.
Oppression has degraded her children, and
broken her spirit. Hence those prodigious plains,
which God hath given for their good, are neglected;
hence, too, the beauteous seas are without a sail; the
lands of ancient Sicyon so thinly peopled!</p>

<h2>NO. XXX.&mdash;SIDON.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Ph&#339;nicia</span> comprised Sidon, Tyre, Ptolemais, and
Berytus. Its mountains were Libanus and Anti-Libanus.
Its most ancient city was Sidon; which
was an opulent city even at so early a period as that
in which the Greeks are said to have lived upon
acorns. It is situated on the shores of the Mediterranean,
at a distance of about twenty miles from
Tyre, and fifty from Damascus.</p>

<p>Sidon is supposed to have been built by Canaan&#8217;s
first-born, whose name was Sidon<a name="FNanchor_225_234" id="FNanchor_225_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_234" class="fnanchor">225</a>. It is, therefore,
celebrated as the most ancient of the cities of Ph&#339;nicia.
It is frequently mentioned in holy writ. It
is named by Jacob<a name="FNanchor_226_235" id="FNanchor_226_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_235" class="fnanchor">226</a>, in his prophetic speech concerning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>the country which his sons were to inhabit; and it
is stated as a place for some of the kings who were
driven out by Joshua. Its remote origin, however,
is perhaps still uncertain, though Justin speaks of it
in the following manner:&mdash;&#8220;The nation of the
Tyrians, descended from the Ph&#339;nicians, being shaken
by an earthquake, and having abandoned their country,
did first inhabit the Assyrian marsh; and, not
long afterwards, the shore next unto the sea, where
they built a city, and called it Sidon, from the abundance
of fishes that were there: for the Ph&#339;nicians
call a fish <i>sidon</i>. After the process of many years,
being overcome by king Ascalon, they took shipping
again, and built Tyre in the year before the destruction
of Troy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot help thinking,&#8221; says Mr. Drummond,
&#8220;that the city, called Tsidon by the Hebrews;
Tsaid or Tsaida, by the Syrians; and Said or Saida,
by the Arabians; originally received its name from
the language of the last. The Tsidonians were
celebrated for their skill in metallurgy, and for the
art with which they worked in gold, silver, and
brass. Much iron and brass existed in Ph&#339;nicia,
and the possession of this country having been once
intended for the tribe of Ashur, Moses said to that
tribe, &#8216;under thy shoes shall be iron and brass:&#8217;
(Deut. xxxiii. 25.): that is, the soil under thy feet
shall abound with iron and brass. Now I consider
Sidon, or rather Saida, to have been so called from
its abounding with <i>saidi</i> or <i>saidan</i>, viz. brass.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_227_236" id="FNanchor_227_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_236" class="fnanchor">227</a></p>

<p>During the administration of Joshua, and afterwards,
Sidon was governed by kings. He calls it
&#8220;Zidon the great.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_228_237" id="FNanchor_228_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_237" class="fnanchor">228</a> In the division of Palestine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>it was allotted to Ashur; but this tribe could never
get possession of it.<a name="FNanchor_229_238" id="FNanchor_229_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_238" class="fnanchor">229</a></p>

<p>The inhabitants are said to have assisted Solomon,
in his preparations for the building of the temple;
their skill in hewing timber being superior to that
of all other nations.<a name="FNanchor_230_239" id="FNanchor_230_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_239" class="fnanchor">230</a></p>

<p>That Sidon was celebrated for its women being
skilled in embroidery, we learn, in the first instance,
from several passages in Scripture; and secondly,
from a curious passage in Homer:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Phrygian queen to her rich wardrobe went,</span>
<span class="i0">Where treasured odours breathed a costly scent.</span>
<span class="i0">There lay the vestures of no vulgar art,</span>
<span class="i0">Sidonian maids embroider&#8217;d every part,</span>
<span class="i0">Whom from soft Sidon youthful Paris bore,</span>
<span class="i0">With Helen touching on the Tyrian shore.</span>
<span class="i0">Here as the queen revolved with careful eyes</span>
<span class="i0">The various textures and the various dyes,</span>
<span class="i0">She chose a veil that shone superior far,</span>
<span class="i0">And glow&#8217;d refulgent as the morning star.<a name="FNanchor_231_240" id="FNanchor_231_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_240" class="fnanchor">231</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>To the Sidonians, also, are attributed the inventions
of glass,<a name="FNanchor_232_241" id="FNanchor_232_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_241" class="fnanchor">232</a> linen, and purple dye. They were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>also greatly celebrated for their industry. They
were highly commercial, and were famous for the
many voyages some of their fellow-citizens undertook.
It was the most ancient of maritime cities:
illustrious for its wealth, for the sobriety and industry
of its inhabitants; for the wisdom of its
councils, and for its skill, not only in commerce and
geography, but in astronomy.</p>

<p>The Sidonians were often engaged in war; but
we can afford space only to a few instances. The
origin of that with Artaxerxes Ochus, is thus related
by Diodorus:<a name="FNanchor_233_242" id="FNanchor_233_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_242" class="fnanchor">233</a>&mdash;&#8220;The king&#8217;s lieutenants and
generals then in Sidon, carrying themselves, by their
severe edicts, rigorously and haughtily towards the
Sidonians, the citizens, being so abused, and not
being able longer to brook it, studied how to revolt
from the Persians. Upon which, the rest of the
Ph&#339;nicians, being wrought upon by the others to
vindicate their liberty, sent messengers to Nectanetus,
the king of Egypt, then at war with the
Persians, to receive them as confederates, and so the
whole nation (Ph&#339;nicia,) prepared for war. And
being that Sidon exceeded all the rest of the cities
in wealth, and even private men, by the advantage
of trade, were grown very rich, they built a great
number of ships, and raised a potent army of mercenaries;
and both arms, and darts, and provisions,
and all other things necessary for war were prepared;
and that they might appear first in the war, they
spoiled and ruined the king&#8217;s garden, cutting down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>all the trees, where the Persian kings used to recreate
and divert themselves. Then they burned all the hay,
which the lieutenants had laid up for the horses. At
last they seized upon the Persians, who had so insulted
them, and led them to punishment, and in
this manner began the war of the Persians with the
Ph&#339;nicians.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ochus Artaxerxes acted in a manner so contrary to
all the best notions of government, that some historians
have not hesitated to regard him as the most cruel and
wicked of all the princes of his race. Not only the
palace, but the empire was filled with his murderers.
Several nations, over whom he exercised sway, in consequence
revolted. Amongst these, Sidon and the
other Ph&#339;nician cities. Ochus hearing of this, resolved
to go in person to reduce the rebels. He repaired
to Ph&#339;nicia with an army of 300,000 foot, and 30,000
horse. Mentor was at this time in Sidon with some
troops from Greece. He had come thither to assist the
rebels. When he learned how great a force the Persian
king had, he was so alarmed, that he sent
secretly to the king to offer to deliver up Sidon. This
offer Ochus accepted; and the king of Sidon having
come into the treason, the city was surrendered into
his hands.</p>

<p>When the Sidonians saw themselves betrayed, and
that the enemy had got entire possession of their
city, they gave themselves up to despair, shut themselves
up in their houses, and set them on fire. In
this manner 40,000 men, besides women and children,
perished in the flames! At this time, Sidon was so
immensely rich, that the cinders, among which a vast
quantity of gold and silver had melted, were sold by
the conqueror for a large sum of money.</p>

<p>This judgment had been prophesied by Ezekiel<a name="FNanchor_234_243" id="FNanchor_234_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_243" class="fnanchor">234</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;20. Again the word of the Lord came unto me,
saying,</p>

<p>&#8220;21. Son of man, set thy face against Zidon, and prophesy
against it.</p>

<p>&#8220;22. And say, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold I
am against thee, O Zidon; and I will be glorified in
the midst of thee: and they shall know that I am
the Lord, when I shall have executed judgments in
her, and shall be sanctified in her.</p>

<p>&#8220;23. For I will send into her pestilence, and blood
into her streets; and the wounded shall be judged in
the midst of her by the sword upon her on every
side; and they shall know that I am the Lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eighteen years after this misfortune, Alexander of
Macedon marched into Ph&#339;nicia. All submitted to
him as he advanced; nor did any people do this with
greater alacrity than the Sidonians: who, having
suffered so largely from the Persian king, held the
Persians in very great detestation. Strato, their king,
however, having declared for Darius, Alexander desired
Hephæstion to place in his stead any one of the
Sidonians that he should judge worthy of so exalted
a station. Being quartered at the house of two brothers,
of whom he had reason to entertain the highest
opinion, Hephæstion offered the crown to them;
but these brothers had the virtue to refuse it, telling
him, that, by the laws of the country, no one could
ascend the throne but those who were of the blood-royal.
Hephæstion, greatly moved at seeing the
greatness of those who could refuse what so many
others had striven to obtain by fire and sword, expressed
his admiration of their magnanimity; and
desired them to name any person of the royal family
who would, on being placed upon the throne, remember
who it was that put him there. On this the
brothers answered, that they knew of no one more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
worthy of a diadem than a person, named Abdolonymus.
He was, they said, of the royal family, though
at a great distance from the succession; but so poor
that he was compelled to earn his bread by working
in one of the gardens outside the city. He was not
only poor, they continued, but of so contented a
spirit, of so exalted a mind, and of such deep engagement
of purpose, that the wars, which were then
shaking Asia, were altogether unknown to him.</p>

<p>The two brothers immediately repaired to the
place where they knew this person was to be found.
They took royal garments with them; and after no
great search found him employed in weeding his
garden. They immediately saluted him as King of
Sidon. &#8220;You must change your tatters,&#8221; said one
of the brothers, &#8220;for the royal garments we have
brought with us. Put off that mean and contemptible
habit, in which you have grown old. Assume
the style and sentiments of a prince. When, however,
you are seated on the throne, continue to preserve the
virtues which have made you worthy of it.&#8221; When
Abdolonymus heard this, he was amazed. He looked
upon the whole as a dream. When, however, he
perceived that the two brothers were standing before
him in actual presence, he inquired of them if they
did not feel some shame in ridiculing him in that
manner? They replied, that no ridicule was intended;
but that all was in the spirit of honour. They threw
over his shoulders a purple raiment, richly embroidered
with gold; repeated to him oaths of earnestness,
and led him to the palace.</p>

<p>The news of this astonishing circumstance soon
spread over the whole city. Most of the richer sort
were indignant. Alexander, however, commanded
that the newly elected prince should be brought into
his presence. When he was presented, Alexander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
measured him with his eye from head to foot, and
gazed upon his countenance for some time. At length
he addressed him after the following manner:&mdash;&#8220;Thine
air and thy mien by no means contradict what I have
heard, in regard to thy extraction; and I therefore desire
to know in what spirit thou hast borne the abject
condition to which thou wert reduced.&#8221; &#8220;Would to
the gods,&#8221; answered Abdolonymus, &#8220;that I may
bear this crown with equal patience! These hands
have procured to me all I have enjoyed; for whilst
I had nothing, I wanted nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Alexander heard this, he was so struck
with admiration, that he not only presented him with
all the furniture that had belonged to Strato, and
part of the riches he had himself acquired in Persia,
but he annexed to his dominions one of the neighbouring
provinces.</p>

<p>At this period, Quietus Curtius says<a name="FNanchor_235_244" id="FNanchor_235_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_244" class="fnanchor">235</a>, Sidon was
a city greatly celebrated on account of its antiquity
and its founder.</p>

<p>Upon an elevation, on the south side of the city,
stood a fine old castle, now in ruins. It was built
by Lewis IX. of France, surnamed the Saint; who
also repaired the city during the Holy Wars<a name="FNanchor_236_245" id="FNanchor_236_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_245" class="fnanchor">236</a>. In
subsequent times it fell into decay; but its final ruin
is said to have been effected by Feckerdine, Emir of
the Druses, when he had established an independent
power, with the view of preventing the Grand
Signior from landing a maritime force here to act
against him. He destroyed all the little ports, from
Bairout to Acra, by sinking boats and stones to prevent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
the Turkish ships from entering them<a name="FNanchor_237_246" id="FNanchor_237_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_246" class="fnanchor">237</a>. He
then built a castle, which still exists. He erected
also a magnificent palace in the Italian style; but
that is in ruins.</p>

<p>In the time of Volney, Sayda contained about five
thousand inhabitants; in 1816 from six thousand
to seven thousand. Of these there are one thousand
Christians, five hundred Jews, the rest are Mahommedans.
The climate is mild, agreeable, and
healthy.</p>

<p>The huge stones of which the mole was built may
still be seen, being capable of filling its whole thickness.
Some of these are twelve feet long, eleven
broad, and five deep. It is supposed to have been
built by Lewis IX.; but this, perhaps, was not the
case, since it contains, on the top of it, a work of a
much more ancient date.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the town is a modern fort,
built by Degnizlu; but consisting merely of a large
tower, incapable of resisting any serious attack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sidon was the mother of Tyre,&#8221; says Mr. Robinson;
&#8220;yet it was speedily eclipsed by that city, in
fame, in riches, and in importance. After sharing
in its fortunes, during the space of many centuries,
it has finally survived its rival, and is again a place
of considerable trade.&#8221;</p>

<p>The buildings of Sayda, according to Mr. Buckingham,
are not at all superior to the common order of
Mahommedan edifices in the modern towns of Syria.
The streets are extremely narrow, the mosques mean,
the caravanserais small and incommodious, and the
bazaars few, and badly furnished even with the commonest
necessaries. According to another traveller,
Sayda is ill-built, dirty, and full of ruins. These
ruins, however, are of a comparatively modern date.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
Few of ancient times remain. There is, nevertheless,
a large tesselated pavement of variegated
marble, representing a horse, and tolerably perfect
in some parts for ten feet in length, remaining close to
the sea, on the northern extremity of the city, which
shows that the sea encroaches on the land. There
are also several columns of granite wrought into
the walls; and some stand as posts on the bridge
leading to the fort; and near the gate of the town
is a small square building, which contains the tombs
of such of the Emirs of the Druses as died when
Sayda was in their possession.</p>

<p>Sayda is the principal port of Damascus. The
harbour, like all those on this coast, was formed with
much art, and at an immense expense, by means of
long piers. These works, which subsisted entire
under the lower empire, are now fallen into decay.
&#8220;So great are the mutations, occasioned by time,&#8221;
says Mr. Buckingham, &#8220;that but for the identity of
name and position, there would be scarcely any marks
left by which to recognise even the site of the present
emporium here alluded to. The stranger, who visits
it in its present state, will look around in vain for any
of those vestiges of its former grandeur which the
description of the ancient historians would lead him
to expect; and which, indeed, are still to be seen in
most of the other celebrated cities of the East,&mdash;whether
in Greece, Egypt, Syria, or Asia Minor.<a name="FNanchor_238_247" id="FNanchor_238_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_247" class="fnanchor">238</a>&#8221;</p>

<h2>NO. XXXI.&mdash;SMYRNA.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> true origin of Smyrna is rather doubtful. One
account is, that such of the Achaians as were descended
from &AElig;olus, and had hitherto inhabited Laconia,
being driven thence by the Dorians, after some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>wandering, settled in that part of Asia Minor which,
from them, was called &AElig;olis; where they founded
twelve cities, one of which was Smyrna. According
to Herodotus, however, it owed its foundation to
the Curmæans, who were of Thessalian extraction;
who, having built the city of Cuma, and finding it
too small to contain their number, erected another
city, which they named Smyrna, from the wife of
their general, Theseus. According to some, it was
built by Tantalus; and others insist, and perhaps
with great truth, that it was founded by persons who
inhabited a quarter of Ephesus called Smyrna. Some
have ascribed it to an Amazon of that name: in respect
to whom Sir George Wheler informs us, that
they stamped their money with a figure of her head,
and that he got several pieces of them very rare, and
saw many more. One small one had her head
crowned with towers, and a two-edged hatchet on
her shoulder. On another her whole habit; thus&mdash;her
head crowned with a tower, as before; a two-edged
axe upon her shoulder, holding a temple in her
right hand, with a short vest let down to her knees, and
buskins half way up her legs. On another she was
dressed in the habit of a Hercules. Whatever its
origin might be, certain it is, that it was one of the
richest and most powerful cities of Asia, and became
one of the twelve cities of the Ionian confederacy.</p>

<p>Smyrna has been subject to many revolutions, and
been severally in the possession of the &AElig;olians,
Ionians, and Macedonians.</p>

<p>The Lydians took possession under Ardys, son of
Gyges; and having destroyed it, the inhabitants dispersed
themselves into several districts.</p>

<p>Alexander, in compliance with the directions of a
vision, he saw near the temple of the Furies, rebuilt it
four hundred years after it had been destroyed by the
Lydians. Strabo, however, attributes its re-establishment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
to Antigonus and Lysimachus. But as neither that
author nor Arrian mention Alexander as having done
so, it is not improbable that he only meditated the
doing so; that Antigonus followed up his design;
and that Lysimachus carried its completion into effect.</p>

<p>At Smyrna there were none of the tyrants, who
oppressed many other cities of Asia. Even the
Romans respected the happy state of this town, and
left it the shadow of liberty. This is a fine panegyric
upon the system of polity, that must have been
adopted and invariably preserved.</p>

<p>There is another circumstance, highly to its honour:
the inhabitants believed that Homer was born in
their city, and they showed a place which bore the
poet&#8217;s name. They also paid him divine honours.
Of all the cities, which contended for the honour of
having given birth to this transcendant poet, Smyrna
has undoubtedly the most reason on her side.
Herodotus absolutely decides in favour of Smyrna,
assuring us, that he was born on the banks of the
river Meles, whence he took the name of Melesigenes.</p>

<p>The inhabitants are said to have been much given
to luxury and indolence; but they were universally
esteemed for their valour and intrepidity when called
into action. Anacharsis is made to speak of their
city in the following manner:&mdash;&#8220;Our road, which
was almost everywhere overshadowed by beautiful
andrachnes, led us to the mouth of the Hermus;
and thence our view extended over that superb bay,
formed by a peninsula, on which are the cities of
Erythræ and Teos. At the bottom of it are some
small villages, the unfortunate remains of the ancient
city of Smyrna, formerly destroyed by the Lydians.
They still bear the same name; and, should circumstances
one day permit the inhabitants to unite and
form one town, defended by walls, their situation
will doubtless attract an immense commerce.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the first town of Asia Minor, according to
Tacitus, which, even during the existence of Carthage,
erected any temple to &#8220;Rome the Goddess.&#8221; Part
of the city was destroyed by Dolabella, when he
slew Trebonius, one of the conspirators against Cæsar.
But it flourished greatly under the early emperors:
Marcus Aurelius repaired it after it had been
destroyed by an earthquake; and under Caracalla it
took the name of the first city of Asia.</p>

<p>Smyrna was much celebrated for its stately buildings,
magnificent temples, and marble porticoes. It
had several grand porticoes of a square form, amongst
which was one in which stood a temple of Homer,
adorned with a statue of the bard. There was also
a gymnasium, and a temple dedicated to the mother
of the gods. Where the gymnasium was, however,
is now past conjecture; but part of its theatre was
still in existence in the time of Sir George Wheler.
&#8220;The theatre,&#8221; says he, &#8220;is on the brow of the hill
north of the course, built of white marble, but now
is going to be destroyed, to build the new Kan and
Bazar hard by the fort below, which they are now
about; and in doing whereof there hath been lately
found a pot of medals, all of the emperor Gallienus&#8217;
family, and the other tyrants that reigned in his
time.&#8221; There were also there the remains of a circus,
and a considerable number of ancient foundations
and noble structures; but what they were Sir George
considered uncertain. He found also many inscriptions
and medals, on which the names of Tiberius,
Claudius, and Nero were to be read; on others, sepulchral
monuments. Among these, was one with an
inscription &#8220;<i>to the emperor Adrian, Olympian,
Saviour and Founder</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the Armenian church-yard he saw an inscription&mdash;&#8220;<i>Good
Fortune to the most splendid Metropolitan,
and thrice Neocorus of the emperor, according</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
<i>to the judgment of the most holy senate of
Smyrniotes</i><a name="FNanchor_239_248" id="FNanchor_239_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_248" class="fnanchor">239</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many writers do not seem to be aware, that the
ancient Smyrna did not occupy the spot where
modern Smyrna stands, but one about two miles and a
half distant. It was built partly on the brow of a
hill, and partly on a plain towards the port, and had
a temple dedicated to Cybele. It was then the most
beautiful of all the Asiatic cities. &#8220;But that which
was, and ever will be, its true glory,&#8221; says Sir
George Wheler, &#8220;was their early reception of the
gospel of Jesus Christ&mdash;glorious in the testimony he
has given of them, and happy in the faithful promises
he made to them. Let us, therefore, consider
what he writeth to them by the Evangelist St.
John:&mdash;(Apoc. ii. 9.) &#8216;I know thy works and tribulation,
and poverty; but thou art rich. And I
know the blasphemy of them, that say they are
Jews, and are not: but are the Synagogue of Satan.
Fear none of those things, which thou shalt suffer.
Behold, the Devil shall cast some of ye in prison,
that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation
ten days. Be thou faithful unto death; and I will
give thee a crown of life.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Previous to the year 1675, it had been partially
destroyed, and several times, by earthquakes; and
it was predicted that a seventh convulsion would be
fatal to the whole city. Such a calamity, attended
by a dreadful fire, and the swallowing up of multitudes
by the incursion of the sea, recurred in 1688,
and did, indeed, very nearly fulfil the prophecy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
&#8220;Repeated strokes,&#8221; says Sir John Hobhouse, &#8220;and
almost annual pestilences, have since that period
laid waste this devoted city; and yet the convenience
of a most spacious and secure harbour, together with
the luxuriant fertility of the surrounding country,
and the prescriptive excellence allowed nearly two
thousand years to this port, in preference to the other
maritime stations of Asia Minor, still operate to collect
and keep together a vast mass of inhabitants from
every quarter of the globe.&#8221;</p>

<p>According to Pococke, the city might have been
about four miles in compass; of a triangular form.
It seems to have extended about a mile on the sea,
and three miles on the north, south, and east sides,
taking in the compass of the castle. This stands on
the remains of the ancient castle, the walls of which
were of the same kind of architecture as the city
walls on the hill. It is all in ruins, except a small
part of the west end, which is always kept shut
up.</p>

<p>One of the gateways of white marble has been
brought from another place; and in the architrave
round the arch there is a Greek inscription of the
middle ages. At another gate there is a colossal head,
said to be that of the Amazon Smyrna. It is of
fine workmanship, and the tresses particularly flow
in a very natural manner. &#8220;Smyrna,&#8221; says Pococke,
&#8220;was one of the finest cities in these parts, and the
streets were beautifully laid out, well-paved, and
adorned with porticoes, both above and below.
There was also a temple of Mars, a circus, and a
theatre; and yet there is now very little to be seen
of all these things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Upon a survey of the castle, Dr. Chandler collected,
that, after being re-edified by John Angelus
Comnenus, its condition, though less ruinous than
before, was far more mean and ignoble. The old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
wall, of which many remnants may be discovered,
is of a solid massive construction, worthy of Alexander
and his captains. All the repairs are mere
patchwork. On the arch of a gateway, which is of
marble, is inscribed a copy of verses, giving an elegant
and poetical description of the extreme misery
from which the above-mentioned emperor raised the
city; concluding with an address to the Omnipotent
Ruler of heaven and earth, that he would grant
him and his queen, whose beauty it celebrates, a
reign of many years. On each side is an eagle, rudely
cut.</p>

<p>Near the sea is the ground-work of a stadium,
stripped of its marble seats and decorations. Below
the theatre is part of a slight wall. The city walls
have long since been demolished. Even its ruins
are removed. Beyond the deep valley, however,
in which the Meles winds, behind the castle, are
several portions of the wall of the Pom&#339;rium, which
encompassed the city at a distance, but broken.
The facings are gone, and masses left only of rubble
and cement.</p>

<p>The ancient city has supplied materials for those
public edifices, which have been erected by the Turks.
The Bezestan and the Vizir khan were both raised
with the white marble of the theatre. The very
ruins of the stones and temples are vanished. &#8220;We
saw,&#8221; says Dr. Chandler, &#8220;remains of one only;
some shafts of columns of variegated marble, much
injured, in the way ascending through the town to
the castle. Many pedestals, statues, inscriptions,
and medals have been, and are still, discovered in
digging. Perhaps,&#8221; continues our author, &#8220;no place
has contributed more to enrich the cabinets and collections
of Europe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Smyrna,&#8221; says a celebrated French writer, &#8220;the
queen of the cities of Anatolia, and extolled by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
ancients under the title of &#8216;the lovely, the crown of
Ionia, the ornament of Asia,&#8217; braves the reiterated
efforts of conflagrations and earthquakes. Ten times
destroyed, she has ten times risen from her ruins with
new splendour. According to a very common Grecian
system, the principal buildings were erected on the
face of a hill fronting the sea. The hill supplied
marble, while its slope afforded a place for the seats
rising gradually above each other in the stadium, or
the great theatre for the exhibition of games. Almost
every trace of the ancient city, however, has
been obliterated during the contests between the
Greek empire and the Ottomans, and afterwards by
the ravages of Timour, in 1402. The foundation of
the stadium remains; but the area is sown with grain.
There are only a few vestiges of the theatre; and the
castle, which crowns the hill, is chiefly patchwork,
executed by John Comnenus on the ruins of the old
one, the walls of which, of immense strength and
thickness, may still be discovered.&#8221;</p>

<p>This city was visited a short time since by the
celebrated French poet and traveller Lamartine.
He has thus spoken of its environs:&mdash;&#8220;The view
from the top of the hill over the gulf and city is
beautiful. On descending the hill to the margin of
the river, which I like to believe is the Meles, we
were delighted with the situation of the bridge of the
caravans, very near one of the gates of the town.
The river is limpid, slumbering under a peaceful arch
of sycamores and cypresses; we seated ourselves on
its bank. If this stream heard the first notes of
Homer, I love to hear its gentle murmurings amidst
the roots of the palm-trees; I raise its waters to my
lips. Oh! might that man appear from the Western
world, who should weave its history, its dreams, and
its heaven, into an epic! Such a poem is the sepulchre
of times gone by, to which posterity comes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
venerate traditions, and eternalise by its worship the
great actions and sublime thoughts of human nature.
Its author engraves his name on the pedestal of the
statue which he erects to man, and he lives in all
the ideas with which he enriches the world of imagination.&#8221;</p>

<p>According to the same author, Smyrna in no
respect resembles an Eastern town; it is a large and
elegant factory, where the European consuls and
merchants lead the life of Paris and London.</p>

<p>Though frequently and severely visited by the
plague, it contains one hundred and twenty thousand
inhabitants; and may be considered as the great
emporium of the Levant<a name="FNanchor_240_249" id="FNanchor_240_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_249" class="fnanchor">240</a>.</p>

<h2>NO. XXXII.&mdash;SPALATRO.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Diocletian selected a spot for his retirement,
he solicitously observed, that his palace should
command every beauty that the country afforded.
In this retirement he began to live, to see the beauty
of the sun, and to enjoy, as Vopiscus relates, true
happiness in the society of those he had known in
his youth<a name="FNanchor_241_250" id="FNanchor_241_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_250" class="fnanchor">241</a>. His palace was situated at Spalatro, in
Dalmatia.</p>

<p>While residing at this place, Diocletian made a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>very remarkable and strictly true confession:&mdash;&#8220;Four
or five persons,&#8221; said he, &#8220;who are closely
united, and resolutely determined to impose on a
prince, may do it very easily. They never show
things to him but in such a light as they are sure
will please. They conceal whatever would contribute
to enlighten him; and as they only besiege him
continually, he cannot be informed of any thing but
through their medium, and does nothing but what they
think fit to suggest to him. Hence it is, that he
bestows employments on those he ought to exclude
from them; and, on the other hand, removes from
offices such persons as are most worthy of filling
them. In a word, the best prince is often sold by
these men, though he be ever so vigilant, and even
suspicious of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the voyager enters the bay, the marine wall
and long arcades of the palace, one of the ancient
temples, and other parts of that building, present
themselves. The inhabitants have destroyed some
parts of the palace, in order to procure materials for
building. In other places houses are built of the old
foundations; and modern works are so intermingled
with the ancient, as scarcely to be distinguishable.</p>

<p>The palace of Diocletian possessed all those advantages
of situation, to which the ancients were most
attentive. It was so great that the emperor Constantinus
Porphyrogenitus, who had seen the most
splendid buildings of the ancients, affirms<a name="FNanchor_242_251" id="FNanchor_242_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_251" class="fnanchor">242</a>, that no
plan or description of it could convey a perfect idea
of it. The vast extent of ground which it occupied is
surprising at first sight; the dimensions of one side of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>the quadrangle, including the towers, being no less than
six hundred and ninety-eight feet, and of the other
four hundred and ninety-two feet:&mdash;making the superficial
contents four hundred and thirteen thousand
two hundred and sixteen feet; that is, about nine
and a half English acres. But when it is considered
that it contained proper apartments not only for the
emperor himself, and for the numerous retinue of
officers who attended his court, but likewise edifices
and open spaces for exercises of different kinds, that
it was capable of lodging a prætorian cohort, and that
two temples were erected within its precincts, we shall
not conclude the area to have been too large for such
a variety of buildings.</p>

<p>For a description of this celebrated place, we must
refer to Mr. Adam&#8217;s Antiquities; but there is one
circumstance that may be highly interesting at the
present time, which is, that not the smallest vestige
of a fire-place is to be seen in any part of the building;
and it may be therefore conjectured, that the
various apartments might have been heated by flues
or funnels, conveying and distributing heated air.</p>

<p>Of the temples, one of them was dedicated to
&AElig;sculapius; the ascent to which was by a stair of
fifteen steps, and it received no light but from the
door. Beneath it are vaults of great strength; its
roof is an arch adorned with sunk pannels of beautiful
workmanship, and its walls are of a remarkable
thickness. This temple remains almost entire.</p>

<p>There is another temple, dedicated to Jupiter, who
was worshipped by Diocletian with peculiar veneration;
and in honour of whom he assumed the name
of Jovius. This temple is surrounded with one row
of columns, having a space between them and the
wall. It is lighted by an arched window over the
door, and is vaulted beneath like that of &AElig;sculapius.
There are remains of two other buildings, not much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
inferior in extent, nor probably in original magnificence;
but by the injuries of time, and the depredations
of the Spalatrines, these are reduced to a very
ruinous condition.</p>

<p>Besides these the visitor sees large vaults along
that side of the palace which looks to the sea; partly
destroyed, partly filled up, and some occupied by
merchants as storehouses.</p>

<p>In one of the towers belonging to the palace, Diocletian
is supposed to have been buried; and we are
told that, about two hundred and seventy-five years
ago, the body of the emperor was discovered there in
a sarcophagus of porphyry.</p>

<p>The shafts of the columns of the temple of Jupiter
are of oriental alabaster of one stone. The capitals
and bases of the columns, and on the entablature, are
of Parian marble. The shafts of the columns of the
second order, which is composite, are alternately of
verd-antique, or ancient green marble and porphyry,
of one piece. The capitals and entablature are also
of Parian marble.</p>

<p>All the capitals throughout the palace are raffled
more in the Grecian than the Roman style; so
that Mr. Adam<a name="FNanchor_243_252" id="FNanchor_243_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_252" class="fnanchor">243</a> thinks it probable, that Diocletian,
who had been so often in Greece, brought his artificers
thither, in order to vary the execution of his

<h2>NO. XXXIII.&mdash;STRATONICE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> was a town in Caria, where a Macedonian
colony took up their abode; and which several
Syrian monarchs afterwards adorned and beautified.
It was named after the wife of Antiochus Soter, of whom
history gives the following account. &#8220;Antiochus
was seized with a lingering distemper, of which the
physicians were incapable of discovering the cause;
for which reason his condition was thought entirely
desperate. Erasistratus, the most attentive and skilful
of all the physicians, having carefully considered
every symptom with which the indisposition of the
young prince was attended, believed at last that he
had discovered its true cause, and that it proceeded
from a passion he had entertained for some lady; in
which conjecture he was not deceived. It, however,
was more difficult to discover the object of a passion,
the more violent from the secrecy in which it remained.
The physician, therefore, to assure himself
fully of what he surmised, passed whole days in the
apartment of his patient, and when he saw any lady
enter, he carefully observed the countenance of the
prince, and never discovered the least emotion in him,
except when Stratonice came into the chamber, either
alone, or with her consort; at which times the young
prince was, as Plutarch observes, always affected
with the symptoms described by Sappho, as so many
indications of a violent passion. Such, for instance,
as a suppression of voice; burning blushes; suffusion
of sight; cold sweat; a sensible inequality and disorder
of pulse; with a variety of the like symptoms.
When the physician was afterwards alone with his
patient, he managed his inquiries with so much dexterity,
as at last drew the secret from him. Antiochus
confessed his passion for queen Stratonice his
mother-in-law, and declared that he had in vain employed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
all his efforts to vanquish it: he added, that
he had a thousand times had recourse to every consideration
that could be represented to his thoughts,
in such a conjuncture; particularly the respect due
from him to a father and a sovereign, by whom he
was tenderly beloved; the shameful circumstance of
indulging a passion altogether unjustifiable, and contrary
to all the rules of decency and honour; the
folly of harbouring a design he ought never to be
desirous of gratifying; but that his reason, in its
present state of distraction, entirely engrossed by
one object, would hearken to nothing. And he concluded
with declaring, that, to punish himself, for
desires involuntary in one sense, but criminal in every
other, he had resolved to languish to death, by discontinuing
all care of his health, and abstaining from
every kind of food. The physician gained a very
considerable point, by penetrating into the source of
his patient&#8217;s disorder; but the application of the proper
remedy was much more difficult to be accomplished;
and how could a proposal of this nature be
made to a parent and king! When Seleucus made
the next inquiry after his son&#8217;s health, Erasistratus
replied, that his distemper was incurable, because it
arose from a secret passion which could never be gratified,
as the lady he loved was not to be obtained.
The father, surprised and afflicted at this answer,
desired to know why the lady was not to be obtained?
&#8216;Because she is my wife!&#8217; replied the physician,
&#8216;and I am not disposed to yield her up to the
embraces of another.&#8217; &#8216;And will you not part with
her then,&#8217; replied the king, &#8216;to preserve the life of a
son I so tenderly love! Is this the friendship you
profess for me?&#8217; &#8216;Let me entreat you, my lord,&#8217;
said Erasistratus, &#8216;to imagine yourself for one moment
in my place, would you resign your Stratonice
to his arms? If you, therefore, who are a father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
would not consent to such a sacrifice for the welfare
of a son so dear to you, how can you expect another
should do it?&#8217; &#8216;I would resign Stratonice, and my
empire to him, with all my soul,&#8217; interrupted the
king. &#8216;Your majesty then,&#8217; replied the physician,
&#8216;has the remedy in your own hands; for he loves
Stratonice.&#8217; The father did not hesitate a moment
after this declaration, and easily obtained the consent
of his consort: after which, his son and that princess
were crowned king and queen of upper Asia. Julian
the Apostate, however, relates in a fragment of his
writings still extant, that Antiochus could not espouse
Stratonice, till after the death of his father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever traces of reserve, moderation, and even
modesty, appear in the conduct of this young prince,&#8221;
says Rollin at the conclusion of this history, &#8220;his
example shows us the misfortune of giving the least
entrance into the heart of an unlawful passion, capable
of discomposing all the happiness and tranquillity
of life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stratonice was a free city under the Romans.
Hadrian erected several structures in it, and thence
took the opportunity of calling it Hadrianopolis.</p>

<p>It is now a poor village, and called Eskihissar. It
was remarkable for a magnificent temple, dedicated
to Jupiter, of which no foundations are now to be
traced, but in one part of the village there is a grand
gate of a plain architecture. There was a double
row of large pillars from it, which probably formed
the avenue to the temple; and on each side of the
gate there was a semicircular alcove niche, and a
colonnade from it, which, with a wall on each side
of the gate, might make a portico, that was of the
Corinthian order. Fifty paces further there are remains
of another colonnade. To the south of this
are ruins of a building of large hewn stone, supposed
to have belonged to the temple of Serapis. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
is also a large theatre, the front of which is ruined;
there are in all about forty seats, with a gallery in
the middle, and another at the top.</p>

<p>Chandler gives a very agreeable account of this
village:&mdash;&#8220;The houses are scattered among woody hills
environed by huge mountains; one of which has its
summit as white as chalk. It is watered by a limpid
and lively rill, with cascades. The site is strewed
with marble fragments. Some shafts of columns are
standing single; and one with a capital on it. By
a cottage are three, with a pilaster supporting an
entablature, but enveloped in thick vines and
trees. Near the theatre are several pedestals of
statues; one records a citizen of great merit and
magnificence. Above it is a marble heap; and the
whole building is overgrown with moss, bushes, and
trees. Without the village, on the opposite side, are
broken arches, with pieces of massive wall and sarcophagi.
Several altars also remain, with inscriptions;
once placed in sepulchres<a name="FNanchor_245_254" id="FNanchor_245_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_254" class="fnanchor">245</a>.&#8221;</p>

<h2>NO. XXXIV.&mdash;SUSA.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Strabo</span> says that Susa was built by Tithonus or
Tithon, the father of Memnon; and this origin is in
some degree supported by a passage in Herodotus,
wherein that historian calls it &#8220;the city of Memnon.&#8221;
In Scripture it is called &#8220;Shushan.&#8221; It was an
oblong of one hundred and twenty stadia in circuit;
situated on the river Cutæus or Uhlai.</p>

<p>Susa derived its name from the number of lilies
which grew on the banks of the river on which it
stood. It was sheltered by a high ridge of mountains
on the north, which rendered it very agreeable during
winter. But in summer the heat was so intense and
parching, that the inhabitants were accustomed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>cover their houses two cubits deep with earth. It
was in this city that Ahasuerus gave the great feast
which lasted one hundred and eighty-three days.</p>

<p>Barthelemy makes Anacharsis write to his friend
in Scythia to the following purport:&mdash;&#8220;The kings of
Persia, besides Persepolis, have caused other palaces
to be built; less sumptuous, indeed, but of wonderful
beauty, at Ecbatana and Susa. They have, also,
spacious parks, which they call paradises, and which
are divided into two parts. In the one, armed with
arrows and javelins, they pursue on horseback,
through the forests, the deer which are shut up in
them; and in the other, in which the art of gardening
has exhausted its utmost efforts, they cultivate
the most beautiful flowers, and gather the most delicious
fruits. They are not less attentive to adorn
these parks with superb trees, which they commonly
dispose in the form called Quincunx.&#8221; He gives, also,
an account of the great encouragement afforded to
agriculture. &#8220;But our attention was still more engaged
by the conspicuous protection and encouragement
which the sovereign grants to agriculture; and
that, not by some transient favours and rewards, but
by an enlightened vigilance more powerful than
edicts and laws. He appoints in every district two
superintendants; one for the military, and the other
for civil affairs. The office of the former is to preserve
the public tranquillity; and that of the latter
to promote the progress of industry and agriculture.
If one of these should not discharge his duty, the
other may complain of him to the governor of the
province, or the sovereign himself. If the monarch
sees the country covered with trees, harvests, and all
the productions of which the soil is capable, he heaps
honours on the two officers, and enlarges their government.
But if he finds the lands uncultivated, they
are directly displaced, and others appointed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
their stead. Commissioners of incorruptible integrity
exercise the same justice in the districts through
which the sovereign does not pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>Susa is rendered remarkable by the immensity of
wealth, hoarded up in it by the Persian kings, and
which fell into the hands of Alexander, when, twenty
days after leaving Babylon, he took possession of that
city. There were 50,000 talents<a name="FNanchor_246_255" id="FNanchor_246_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_255" class="fnanchor">246</a> of silver in ore
and ingots; a sum equivalent, of our money, to
7,500,000<i>l.</i> Besides this, there were five thousand
talents&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_247_256" id="FNanchor_247_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_256" class="fnanchor">247</a> worth of purple of Hermione, which, though
it had been laid up for one hundred and ninety years,
retained its freshness and beauty: the reason assigned
for which is, that the purple wool was combed with
honey, and the white with white oil<a name="FNanchor_248_257" id="FNanchor_248_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_257" class="fnanchor">248</a>. Besides this,
there were a thousand other things of extraordinary
value. &#8220;This wealth,&#8221; says one of the historians,
&#8220;was the produce of the exactions imposed for several
centuries upon the common people, from whose
sweat and poverty immense revenues were raised.&#8221;
&#8220;The Persian monarchy,&#8221; he goes on to observe,
&#8220;fancied they had amassed them for their children and
posterity; but, in one hour, they fell into the hands
of a foreign king, who was able to make a right use
of them: for Alexander seemed to be merely the
guardian or trustee of the immense riches which he
found hoarded up in Persia; and applied them to no
other use than the rewarding of courage and merit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here, too, were found many of the rarities which
Xerxes had taken from Greece; and amongst others,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>the brazen statues of Harmodius and Aristogiton,
which Alexander soon after sent to Athens.</p>

<p>This was the city in which a curious scene occurred
between Alexander and Sisygambis, Darius&#8217;
mother, whom he had taken prisoner at the battle
of Issus. He had left her at Susa, with Darius&#8217;
children: and having received a quantity of purple
stuffs and rich habits from Macedonia, made after
the fashion of his own country, he sent them to
Sisygambis; desiring his messengers to tell her, that
if the stuffs pleased her, she might teach her grandchildren,
who were with her, the art of weaving
them for their amusement. Now the working in
wool was considered an ignominy by the Persian
women. When Sisygambis heard Alexander&#8217;s message,
therefore, she burst into tears. This being
related to the conqueror, he thought it decorous
to do away the impression. He therefore visited
Sisygambis. &#8220;Mother,&#8221; said he, for he valued Darius&#8217;
mother next to his own, &#8220;the stuff, in which
you see me clothed, was not only a gift of my sisters,
but wrought by their fingers. Hence I beg you to
believe, that the custom of my country misled me;
and do not consider that as an insult, which was
owing entirely to ignorance. I believe I have not
yet done any thing which I knew interfered with
your manners and customs. I was told, that among
the Persians it is a sort of crime for a son to seat
himself in his mother&#8217;s presence, without first obtaining
her leave. You are sensible how cautious I
have been in that particular; and that I never sat
down till you had first laid your commands upon
me to do so. And every time that you were going to
fall down prostrate before me, I only ask you, whether
I would suffer it? As the highest testimony of the
veneration I owe you, I always called you by the tender
name of mother, though this belongs properly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
Olympia only, to whom I owe my birth.&#8221; On
hearing this Sisygambis was extremely well satisfied,
and became afterwards so partial to the conqueror of
her son and country, that when she heard of the
death of Alexander she wept as if she had lost a
son. &#8220;Who now will take care of my daughters?&#8221;
she exclaimed. &#8220;Where shall we find another Alexander?&#8221;
At last she sank under her grief. &#8220;This
princess,&#8221; says Rollin, &#8220;who had borne with patience
the death of her father, her husband, eighty of her
brothers, who were murdered in one day by Ochus,
and, to say all in one word, that of Darius her son,
and the ruin of her family; though she had, I say,
submitted patiently to all these losses, she however
had not strength of mind sufficient to support herself
after the death of Alexander. She would not take
any sustenance, and starved herself to death, to avoid
surviving this last calamity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexander found in Susa all the captives of quality
he had left there. He married Statira,<a name="FNanchor_249_258" id="FNanchor_249_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_258" class="fnanchor">249</a> Darius&#8217;
eldest daughter, and gave the youngest to his dear
Hephæstion. And in order that, by making these
marriages more common, his own might not be
censured, he persuaded the greatest noblemen in
his court, and his principal favourites, to imitate
him. Accordingly they chose, from amongst the
noblest families of Persia, about eighty young maidens,
whom they married. His design was, by these
alliances, to cement so strongly the union of the two
nations, that they should henceforward form but
one, under his empire. The nuptials were solemnised
after the Persian manner. He likewise feasted
all the rest of the Macedonians who had married before
in that country. It is related that there were
nine thousand guests at this feast, and that he gave
each of them a golden cup for the libations.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span></p>
<p>When at Susa, Alexander found a proof of the
misgovernment of which his satraps had been guilty
during his absence. The Susians loudly complained
of the satrap Abulites, and his son Oxathres, of
spoliation and tyranny. Being convicted of the
crimes of which they were charged, they were both
sentenced to death.</p>

<p>Josephus says, that Daniel&#8217;s wisdom did not only
reach to things divine and political, but also to arts
and sciences, and particularly to that of architecture;
in confirmation of which, he speaks of a famous
edifice built by him at Susa, in the manner of a
castle, which he says still subsisted in his time, and
finished with such wonderful art, that it then seemed
as fresh and beautiful as if it had been but newly
built. &#8220;Within this palace,&#8221; continues Josephus,
&#8220;the Persian and Parthian kings were usually buried;
and, for the sake of the founder, the keeping of it
was committed to one of the Jewish nation, even to
his time. It was a common tradition in those parts
for many ages, that Daniel died at Susa, and there
they show his monument to this day. It is certain
that Daniel used to go thither from time to time, and
he himself tells us, that &#8216;he did the king&#8217;s business
there.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>There being some doubt whether the ancient Susa
is the modern Shus, or the modern Shuster, we shall
not enter into the argument, but describe them both.</p>

<p>The ruins of Shus are situate in the province of
Kuzistan, or Chusistan. They extend about twelve
miles<a name="FNanchor_250_259" id="FNanchor_250_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_259" class="fnanchor">250</a> from one extremity to the other, stretching as
far as the eastern bank of the Kerah, occupying an
immense space between that river and the Abzal;
and, like the ruins of Babylon, Ctesiphon, and Kufa,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>consisting of hillocks of earth and rubbish, covered
with broken pieces of brick and coloured tile.</p>

<p>There are two mounds larger than the rest. The
first is about a mile in circumference, and nearly one
hundred feet in height. The other is not quite so
high, but double the circumference. The Arabs
often dig with a view of getting treasures of gold in
these two mounds; and every now and then discover
large blocks of marble, covered with hieroglyphics.
The mounds in general bear considerable
resemblance to those of Babylon; but with this difference
to distinguish them: instead of being entirely
composed of brick, they consist of clay and pieces of
tile, with irregular layers of brick and mortar, five or
six feet thick, intended, it would seem, as a kind of
prop to the mass. This is one reason for supposing
that Shus is the ancient Susa; and not Shuster. For
Strabo says, that the Persian capital was entirely
built of brick; there not being a single stone in
the province: whereas the quarries of Shuster are
very celebrated; and almost the whole of that town
is built of stone. But let the question, says a modern
traveller, be decided as it may, the site of the
city of Shus is now a gloomy wilderness, infested by
lions, hyænas, and other beasts of prey. &#8220;The dread
of these furious animals,&#8221; says Mr. Kinneir, &#8220;compelled
us to take shelter for the night within the walls
that encompassed Daniel&#8217;s tomb.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the foot of the most elevated of the pyramids
stands what is called &#8220;the Tomb of Daniel;&#8221; a small,
comparatively modern, building, erected on the spot
where the relics of the prophet are believed to rest.
Others doubt this circumstance; among whom is Dr.
Vincent<a name="FNanchor_251_260" id="FNanchor_251_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_260" class="fnanchor">251</a>, who insists, that to the legendary tradition
of the tomb of Daniel little more respect is due, than
to the legends of the church of Rome, and the traditions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
of the Mahometans in general. The antiquity
of the tradition is, nevertheless, considerable; for it
is not only mentioned by Benjamin of Tudela, who
visited Shus in the latter part of the twelfth century,
but by one of the earliest Mussulman writers, Ahmed
of Kufah, who died <span class="smcap lowercase">A. H.</span> 117 (<span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 735), and records
the removal of the prophet&#8217;s coffin to the bed of
the river.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shuster</span> is the capital of Kuzistan, and is situate
at the foot of the mountains of Bucktiari, on an eminence
commanding the rapid course of the Karoon,
across which is a bridge of one arch, upwards of
eighty feet high; from the summit of which the
Persians often throw themselves into the water, without
sustaining the smallest injury. It is situated so
agreeably in respect to climate and supplies of all
kinds, that while Shus, in the old Persian language,
signified &#8220;delightful,&#8221; Shuster had a more expressive
one; &#8220;most delightful.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shuster, from the ruins yet remaining, must have
been once of great magnificence and extent. The
most worthy of observation amongst these ruins are
the castle, a dyke, and a bridge. &#8220;Part of the walls
of the first,&#8221; says Mr. Kinneir, &#8220;said to have been
the abode of Valerian<a name="FNanchor_252_261" id="FNanchor_252_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_261" class="fnanchor">252</a>, are still standing. They occupy
a small hill at the western extremity of the town,
from which there is a fine view of the river, mountains,
and adjoining country. This fortress is, on
two sides, defended by a ditch, now almost choked
with sand; and on the other two, by a branch of the
Karoon. It has but one gateway, built in the Roman
fashion, formerly entered by a draw-bridge. The
hill is almost entirely excavated, and formed into
<i>surdabs</i> and subterranean aqueducts, through which
the water still continues to flow.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span></p>

<p>Not far from the castle is the dyke to which we
have alluded. This dyke was built by Sapor.
&#8220;Not,&#8221; says Mr. Kinneir, as &#8220;D&#8217;Herbelot would
insinuate, to prevent a second deluge, but rather to
occasion one, by turning a large proportion of the
water into a channel more favourable to agriculture,
than that which Nature had assigned to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>This dyke is constructed of cut stone, bound together
by clamps of iron, about twenty-feet broad, and
four hundred yards long, with two small arches in
the middle. It has lately been rebuilt by Mahomet
Ali Maerza, governor of Kermanshaw.</p>

<p>The fate of Valerian, to whom we have alluded, is
thus recorded by Gibbon:&mdash;&#8220;The voice of history,
which is often little more than the organ of hatred or
flattery, reproaches Sapor with a proud abuse of the
rights of conquest. We are told that Valerian, in
chains, but invested with the imperial purple, was
exposed to the multitude, a constant spectacle of
fallen greatness; and that whenever the Persian
monarch mounted on horseback, he placed his foot
upon the neck of a Roman emperor. Notwithstanding
all the remonstrances of his allies, who repeatedly
advised him to remember the vicissitudes of fortune,
to dread the returning power of Rome, and to make
his illustrious captive the pledge of peace, not the
object of insult, Sapor still remained inflexible.
When Valerian sank under the weight of shame and
grief, his skin, stuffed with straw, and formed into
the likeness of a human figure, was preserved for
ages in the most celebrated temple of Persia; a more
real monument of triumph than the sacred trophies
of brass and marble, so often erected by Roman
vanity<a name="FNanchor_253_262" id="FNanchor_253_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_262" class="fnanchor">253</a>. The tale is moral and pathetic; but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>truth of it may very fairly be called in question. It
is unnatural to suppose, that a jealous monarch
should, even in the person of a rival, thus publicly
degrade the majesty of kings. Whatever treatment
the unfortunate Valerian might experience in Persia,
it is at least certain, that the only emperor of Rome
who had ever fallen into the hands of the enemy,
languished away his life in hopeless captivity.&#8221; The
place of that captivity is said to have been Shuster<a name="FNanchor_254_263" id="FNanchor_254_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_263" class="fnanchor">254</a>.</p>

<h2>NO. XXXV.&mdash;SYBARIS.</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dissolved in ease and soft delights they lie,</span>
<span class="i0">Till every sun annoys, and every wind</span>
<span class="i0">Has chilling force, and every rain offends.</span>
<span class="i10"><span class="smcap">Dyer</span>, <i>Ruins of Rome</i>.</span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sybaris</span> was a town of Lucania, situated on the
banks of the Bay of Tarentum. It was founded by
a colony of Achaians; and in process of time became
very powerful.</p>

<p>The walls of this city extend six miles and a half in
circumference, and the suburbs covered the banks of
the Crathis for seven miles.</p>

<p>Historians and orators, of all ages, have been guilty
of praising heroes. &#8220;For my own part,&#8221; says Mr. Swinburne,
&#8220;I cannot help feeling pity for the hard fate of
the Sybarites, to whom we are indebted for the discovery
of many most useful pieces of chamber and
kitchen furniture. They appear to have been a people
of great taste, and to have set the fashion, in
point of dress, throughout all Greece. Their cooks, embroiderers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
and confectioners, were famous over all the
polite world; and we may suppose their riding-masters
did not enjoy a less brilliant reputation, since we are
told of their having taught their horses to dance to a
particular tune. The public voice, however, of all
ages, has been against them. Sybaris<a name="FNanchor_255_264" id="FNanchor_255_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_264" class="fnanchor">255</a> was ten
leagues from Croton. Four neighbouring states, and
twenty-five cities, were subject to it; so that it was
alone able to raise an army of three hundred thousand
men. The opulence of Sybaris was soon followed
by luxury, and such a dissoluteness as is
scarcely possible. The citizens employed themselves
in nothing but banquets, games, shows, parties of
pleasure, and carnivals. Public rewards and marks
of distinction were bestowed on those who gave the
most magnificent entertainments; and even to such
cooks as were best skilled in the important art of
making new refinements to tickle the palate. The
Sybarites carried their delicacy and effeminacy to
such a height, that they carefully removed from their
city all such artificers whose work was noisy; and
would not suffer any cocks in it, lest their shrill,
piercing crow should disturb their slumbers.&#8221;</p>

<p>All these evils were heightened by dissension and
discord, which at last proved their ruin. Five hundred
of the wealthiest in the city having been expelled
by the faction of one Telys, fled to Croton. Telys
demanded to have them surrendered to him; and, on
the refusal of the Crotonians to deliver them up,
prompted to this generous resolution by Pythagoras,
who then lived among them, war was declared. The
Crotonians were headed by Milo, the famous champion;
over whose shoulders a lion&#8217;s skin was thrown, and
himself armed with a club, like another Hercules. The
latter gained a complete victory, and made a dreadful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
havoc of those who fled, so that very few escaped;
and Sybaris was depopulated.</p>

<p>About sixty years after this some Thessalians came
and settled in it; however, they did not long enjoy
peace, being driven out by the Crotonians. Being
thus reduced to the most fatal extremity, they implored
the succour of the Lacedæmonians and Athenians.
The latter, moved to compassion at their
deplorable condition, after causing proclamation to
be made in Peloponnesus, that all who were willing
to assist that colony were at liberty to do it, sent the
Sybarites a fleet of ten ships, under the command of
Lampon and Xenocrates. They built a city near the
ancient Sybaris, and called it Thurium.</p>

<p>Two men, greatly renowned for their learning, the
one an orator, and the other an historian, settled in
this colony. The first was Lysias, at that time but
fifteen years of age. He lived in Thurium, till that
ill fate which befel the Athenians in Sicily, and then
went to Athens.</p>

<p>The second was Herodotus. Though he was
born in Halicarnassus, a city of Caria, he was considered
as a native of Thurium, because he settled
there with that colony. Divisions soon broke out in
the city, on occasion of the new inhabitants, whom
the rest would exclude from all public employments and
privileges. But as these were much more numerous,
they repulsed all the ancient Sybarites, and got the sole
possession of the city. Being supported by the alliance
they made with the people of Croton, they
grew very powerful; and, having settled a popular
form of government in their city, they divided the
citizens into ten tribes, which they called by the
names of the different nations whence they sprang.</p>

<p>Sybaris was destroyed five times; but had always
the good fortune to be restored. It at length, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
fell into irredeemable decay; and, no doubt,
justly, for every excess<a name="FNanchor_256_265" id="FNanchor_256_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_265" class="fnanchor">256</a>, whether of luxury or voluptuousness,
could be found there. The indolence of the
inhabitants was so great, that they boasted that they
never saw the sun either rise or set. The greatest encouragement
was liberally lavished on such as invented
new pleasures; and, as a natural consequence, though
the city enjoyed a long period of prosperity, not a
single citizen&#8217;s name has been preserved to posterity,
who is entitled to admiration, either for deeds of
heroism, or the practice of milder virtues in private
life.</p>

<p>There is, nevertheless, one anecdote recorded in
their favour. Being enslaved by the Lucanians, and
afterwards subjected to the Romans, they still retained
a fond attachment to the manners of Greece;
and are said to have displayed their partiality to their
mother-country, in a manner that evinces both their
taste and their feeling. Being compelled by the will
of the conquerors, or by other circumstances, to adopt
a foreign language and foreign manners, they were
accustomed to assemble annually, on one of the great
festivals of Greece, in order to revive the memory of
their Grecian origin, to speak their primitive language,
and to deplore, with tears and lamentations,
their sad degradation. It would afford peculiar
pleasure to discover some monument of a people of
so much sensibility, and of such persevering patriotism.</p>

<p>Seventy days sufficed to destroy all their grandeur!
Five hundred and seventy-two years before the
Christian era, the Crotoniates, under the famous
athlete Milo, as we have already related, defeated
the Sybarites in a pitched battle, broke down the
dams of the Crathis, and let the furious stream into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>the town, where it soon overturned and swept away
every building of use and ornament. The inhabitants
were massacred without mercy; and the few
that escaped the slaughter, and attempted to restore
their city, were cut to pieces by a colony of Athenians,
who afterwards removed to some distance, and
founded Thurium.</p>

<p>&#8220;Many ages, alas!&#8221; continues Mr. Swinburne,
&#8220;have now revolved since man inhabited these plains
in sufficient numbers to secure salubrity. The rivers
have long rolled lawless over these low, desolated
fields; leaving, as they shrink back to their beds,
black pools and nauseous swamps, to poison the
whole region, and drive mankind still farther from its
ancient possessions. Nothing in reality remains of
Sybaris, which once gave law to nations, and could
muster even so large a force as 300,000 fighting men.
Not one stone remains upon another<a name="FNanchor_257_266" id="FNanchor_257_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_266" class="fnanchor">257</a>!&#8221;</p>

<h2>NO. XXXVI.&mdash;SYENE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> was a town in the Thebais, nearly under the
tropic of Cancer; greatly celebrated for the first attempt
to ascertain the measure of the circumference
of the earth by Eratosthenes, who, about the year
276 <span class="smcap lowercase">A. C.</span>, was invited from Athens to Alexandria,
by Ptolemy Evergetes.</p>

<p>Juvenal, the poet, was banished there, on the pretence
of commanding a cohort, stationed in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Its principal antiquities are a small temple, supposed
to be the remains of Eratosthenes&#8217; observatory,
the remains of a Roman bridge, and the ruins of
the Saracen town. The latter includes the city
wall, built of unburnt bricks, and defended by square
towers, and several mosques with lofty minarets,
and many large houses in a state of wonderful preservation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
still entire, though resting on very frail
foundations.</p>

<p>&#8220;Syene, which, under so many different masters,&#8221;
says a celebrated French geographer, &#8220;has been the
southern frontier of Egypt, presents in a greater degree
than any other spot on the surface of the globe, that
confused mixture of monuments, which, even in the
destinies of the most potent monarchs, reminds us of
human instability. Here the Pharaohs, and the
Ptolemies, raised the temple, and the palaces which
are found half buried under the drifting sand. Here
are forts and villas built by the Romans and Arabians;
and on the remains of all these buildings French inscriptions
are found, attesting that the warriors, and
the learned men of modern Europe, pitched their
tents, and erected their observatories on this spot.
But the eternal power of nature presents a still more
magnificent spectacle. Here are the terraces of
reddish granite, of a particular character, hence
called syenite,&mdash;a term applied to those rocks, which
differ from granite in containing particles of hornblende.
These mighty terraces, are shaped into peaks,
across the bed of the Nile, and over them the river
rolls majestically its impetuous foaming waves.
Here are the quarries from which the obelisks and
colossal statues of the Egyptian temples were dug.
An obelisk, partially formed and still remaining
attached to the native rock, bears testimony to the
labours and patient efforts of human art. On the
polished surfaces of these rocks, hieroglyphic sculptures
represent the Egyptian deities, together with
the sacrifices and offerings of this nation; which,
more than any other, has identified itself with the
country which it inhabited, and has, in the most
literal sense, engraved the records of its glory on the
terrestrial globe&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_258_267" id="FNanchor_258_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_267" class="fnanchor">258</a>.</p>

<h2>NO. XXXVII.&mdash;SYRACUSE.</h2>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">The</span> fame of states, now no longer existing,
lives,&#8221; says Mr. Swinburne, &#8220;in books or tradition;
and we reverence their memory in proportion to the
wisdom of their laws, the private virtues of their
citizens, the policy and courage with which they
defended their own dominions, or advanced their
victorious standards into those of their enemies.
Some nations have rendered their names illustrious,
though their virtues and valour had but a very confined
sphere to move in; while other commonwealths
and monarchies have subdued worlds, and roamed
over whole continents in search of glory and power.
Syracuse must be numbered in the former class, and
amongst the most distinguished of that class. In
public and private wealth, magnificence of buildings,
military renown, and excellence in all arts and
sciences, it ranks higher than most nations of antiquity.
The great names recorded in its annals still
command our veneration; though the trophies of
their victories, and the monuments of their skill,
have long been swept away by the hand of time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Syracuse is a city, the history of which is so
remarkably interesting to all those who love liberty,
that we shall preface our account of its ruins by
adopting some highly important remarks afforded us
by that celebrated and amiable writer to whose
learning and genius we have been so greatly indebted
throughout the whole of this work:&mdash;(Rollin).
&#8220;Syracuse,&#8221; says he, &#8220;appears like a theatre, on
which many surprising scenes have been exhibited;
or rather like a sea, sometimes calm and untroubled,
but oftener violently agitated by winds and storms,
always ready to overwhelm it entirely. We have
seen, in no other republic, such sudden, frequent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
violent, and various revolutions: sometimes enslaved
by the most cruel tyrants; at others, under the
government of the wisest kings: sometimes abandoned
to the capricious will of a populace, without
either government or restriction; sometimes perfectly
docile and submissive to the authority of
law and the empire of reason; it passed alternately
from the most insupportable slavery to the most
grateful liberty; from convulsions and frantic emotions,
to a wise, peaceable, and regular conduct.
To what are such opposite extremes and vicissitudes
to be attributed? Undoubtedly, I think, the
levity and inconstancy of the Syracusans, which
was their distinguishing characteristic, had a great
share in them; but what I am convinced conduced
the most to them, was the very form of their government,
compounded of the aristocratic and democratic;
that is to say, divided between the senate or
elders, and the people. As there was no counterpoise
in Syracuse to support a right balance between
those two bodies, when authority inclined either to
the one side or the other, the government presently
changed, either into a violent and cruel tyranny, or
an unbridled liberty, without order or regulation.
The sudden confusion, at such times, of all orders of
the state, made the way to the sovereign power easy
to the most ambitious of the citizens. To attract
the affection of their country, and soften the yoke to
their fellow-citizens, some exercised that power with
lenity, wisdom, equity, and popular behaviour; and
others, by nature less virtuously inclined, carried it
to the last excess of the most absolute and cruel
despotism, under pretext of supporting themselves
against the attempts of their citizens, who, jealous
of their liberty, thought every means for the recovery
of it legitimate and laudable. There were,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
besides, other reasons that rendered the government
of Syracuse difficult, and thereby made way for the
frequent changes it underwent. That city did not
forget the signal victories it had obtained against the
formidable power of Africa, and that it had carried its
victorious arms and terror even to the walls of Carthage.
Besides which, riches, the natural effect of commerce,
had rendered the Syracusans proud, haughty,
and imperious, and at the same time had plunged
them into a sloth and luxury, that inspired them
with a disgust for all fatigue and application. They
abandoned themselves blindly to their orators, who
had acquired an absolute ascendant over them. In
order to make them obey, it was necessary either to
flatter or reproach them. They had naturally a
fund of equity, humanity, and good nature; and
yet, when influenced by the seditious discourses of
the orators, they would proceed to excessive violence
and cruelties, which they immediately after repented.
When they were left to themselves, their liberty,
which at that time knew no bounds, soon degenerated
into caprice, fury, violence, and even frenzy. On the
contrary, when they were subjected to the yoke, they
became base, timorous, submissive, and creeping like
slaves. With a small attention to the whole series of the
history of the Syracusans, it may easily be perceived,
as Galba afterwards said of the Romans, that they
were equally incapable of bearing either entire liberty
or entire servitude; so that the ability and policy of
those, who governed them, consisted in keeping the
people to a wise medium between those two extremes,
by seeming to leave them an entire freedom in their
resolutions, and reserving only to themselves the care
of explaining the utility, and facilitating the execution,
of good measures. And in this some of its
magistrates and kings were wonderfully successful;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
under whose government the Syracusans always
enjoyed peace and tranquillity, were obedient to
their princes, and perfectly submissive to the laws.
And this induces one to conclude, that the revolutions
of Syracuse were less the effect of the people&#8217;s
levity, than the fault of those that governed them,
who had not the art of managing their passions,
and engaging their affection, which is properly
the science of kings, and of all who command
others.&#8221;</p>

<p>Syracuse was founded about seven hundred and
thirty-two years before the Christian era, by a Corinthian
named Archias; one of the Heraclidæ.</p>

<p>The two first ages of its history are very obscure;
it does not begin to be known till after the age of
Gelon, and furnishes in the sequel many great events
for the space of more than two hundred years.
During all that time it exhibits a perpetual alternation
of slavery under the tyrants, and liberty under
a popular government, till Syracuse is at length
subjected to the Romans, and makes part of their
empire.</p>

<p>The Carthaginians, in concert with Xerxes, having
attacked the Greeks who inhabited Sicily, whilst
that prince was employed in making an irruption
into Greece, Gelon, who had made himself master of
Syracuse, obtained a celebrated victory over the
Carthaginians, the very day of the battle of Thermopylæ.</p>

<p>Gelon, upon returning from his victory, repaired
to the assembly without arms or guards, to give the
people an account of his conduct. He was chosen
king unanimously. He reigned five or six years,
solely employed in the truly royal care of making
his people happy.</p>

<p>Gelon is said to have been the first man who became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
more virtuous by being raised to a throne. He was
eminent for honesty, truth, and sincerity; he never
wronged the meanest of his subjects, and never
promised a thing which he did not perform.</p>

<p>Hiero, the eldest of Gelon&#8217;s brothers, succeeded
him. The beginning of his reign was worthy of
great praise. Simonides and Pindar celebrated him
in emulation of each other. The latter part of it,
however, did not answer the former. He reigned
eleven years.</p>

<p>Thrasybulus, his brother, succeeded him. He
rendered himself odious to all his subjects, by his
vices and cruelty. They expelled him the throne
and city, after a reign of one year.</p>

<p>After his expulsion, Syracuse and all Sicily enjoyed
their liberty for the space of almost sixty
years.</p>

<p>During this interval, the Athenians, animated by
the warm exhortations of Alcibiades, turned their
arms against Syracuse; this was in the sixth year of
the Peloponnesian war. This event was fatal to
the Athenians.</p>

<p>The reign of Dionysius the Elder is famous for
its length of thirty-eight years, and still more for
the extraordinary events with which it was attended.</p>

<p>Dionysius, son of the elder Dionysius, succeeded
him. He contracted a particular intimacy with
Plato, and had frequent conversations with him.
He did not long improve from the wise precepts of
that philosopher, but soon abandoned himself to all
the vices and excesses which attend tyranny.</p>

<p>Besieged by Dion, he escaped from Sicily, and
retired into Italy, where he was assassinated in his
house by Callippus.</p>

<p>Thirteen months after the death of Dion, Hipparinus,
brother of Dionysius the Younger, expelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
Callippus, and established himself in Syracuse.
During the two years of his reign, Sicily was agitated
by great commotions.</p>

<p>Dionysius the Younger, taking advantage of these
troubles, reascends the throne ten years after having
quitted it. At last, reduced by Timoleon, he retires
to Corinth. Here he preserved some semblance of
his former tyranny, by turning schoolmaster, and
exercising a discipline over boys, when he could no
longer tyrannise over men. He had learning, and
was once a scholar to Plato, whom he caused to
come again into Sicily, notwithstanding the unworthy
treatment he had met with from Dionysius&#8217;s father.
Philip, king of Macedon, meeting him in the streets
of Corinth, and asking him how he came to lose so
considerable a principality as had been left him by
his father, he answered, that his father had indeed
left him the inheritance, but not the fortune which
had preserved both himself and that; however,
Fortune did him no great injury, in replacing him
on the dunghill, from which she had raised his
father.</p>

<p>Timoleon restored liberty to Syracuse. He passed
the rest of his life there in a glorious retirement,
beloved and honoured by all the citizens and
strangers.</p>

<p>This interval of liberty was of no long duration.
Agathocles, in a short time, makes himself tyrant
of Syracuse. He commits unparalleled cruelties.
He forms one of the boldest designs related in history,
carries the war into Africa, makes himself master of
the strongest places, and ravages the whole country.
After various events, he perishes miserably, after a
reign of about twenty-eight years<a name="FNanchor_259_268" id="FNanchor_259_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_268" class="fnanchor">259</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span></p>
<p>Syracuse took new life again for some time, and
tasted with joy the sweets of liberty. But she
suffered much from the Carthaginians, who disturbed
her tranquillity by continual wars. She called in
Pyrrhus to her aid. The rapid success of his arms
at first gave him great hopes, which soon vanished.
Pyrrhus, by a sudden retreat, plunged the Syracusans
into new misfortunes. They were not happy
and in tranquillity till the reign of Hiero II., which
was very long, and almost always pacific.</p>

<p>Hieronymus scarce reigned one year. His death
was followed with great troubles, and the taking of
Syracuse by Marcellus.</p>

<p>Of this celebrated siege, since it was the ruin of
Syracuse, it is our duty to give some account.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;The Romans carrying on their attacks at two different
places, Syracuse was in great consternation, and apprehended
that nothing could oppose so terrible a power, and such mighty
efforts; and it had indeed been impossible to have resisted
them, without the assistance of a single man, whose wonderful
industry was every thing to the Syracusans&mdash;this was Archimedes.
He had taken care to supply the walls with all things
necessary to a good defence. As soon as his machines began
to play on the land-side, they discharged upon the infantry all
sorts of darts, and stones of enormous weight, which flew with
so much noise, force, and rapidity, that nothing could oppose
their shock. They beat down and dashed to pieces all before
them.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Marcellus succeeded no better on the side of the sea. Archimedes
had disposed his machines in such a manner as to throw
darts to any distance. Though the enemy lay far from the
city, he reached them with his larger and more forcible balistæ
and catapultæ. When they overshot their mark, he had
smaller, proportioned to the distance, which put the Romans
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>into such confusion as made them incapable of attempting
any thing.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;This was not the greatest danger. Archimedes had placed
lofty and strong machines behind the walls, which suddenly
letting fall vast beams, with an immense weight at the end of
them, upon the ships, sunk them to the bottom. Besides this,
he caused an iron grapple to be let out by a chain; the person
who guided the machine having caught hold of the head of a
ship with this hook, by the means of a weight let down within
the walls, it was lifted up and set upon its stern, and held so
for some time; then, by letting go the chain either by a wheel
or a pulley, it was let fall again with its whole weight either
on its head or side, and often entirely sunk. At other times the
machines dragging the ship towards the shore by cords and
hooks, after having made it whirl about a great while, dashed
it to pieces against the points of the rocks which projected
under the walls, and thereby destroyed all within it. Galleys,
frequently seized and suspended in the air, were whirled about
with rapidity, exhibiting a dreadful sight to the spectators;
after which they were let fall into the sea, and sunk to the
bottom, with all that were in them.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Marcellus, almost discouraged, and at a loss what to do,
retired as fast as possible with his galleys, and sent orders to
his land forces to do the same. He called also a council of
war, in which it was resolved the next day, before sun-rise, to
endeavour to approach the walls. They were in hopes by this
means to shelter themselves from the machines, which, for want
of a distance proportioned to their force, would be rendered ineffectual.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;But Archimedes had provided against all contingencies. He
had prepared machines long before, as we have already observed,
that carried to all distances a proportionate quantity of darts,
and ends of beams, which being very short, required less time
for preparing them, and in consequence were more frequently
discharged. He had besides made small chasms or loop-holes
in the walls at little distances, where he had placed scorpions,
which, not carrying far, wounded those who approached, without
being perceived but by that effect.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;When the Romans, according to their design, had gained the
foot of the walls, and thought themselves well covered, they
found themselves exposed either to an infinity of darts, or overwhelmed
with stones, which fell directly upon their heads;
there being no part of the wall which did not continually pour
that mortal hail upon them. This obliged them to retire.
But they were no sooner removed than a new discharge of darts
overtook them in their retreat; so that they lost great numbers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>of men, and almost all their galleys were disabled or beat to
pieces, without being able to revenge their loss in the least upon
their enemies: for Archimedes had planted most of his machines
in security behind the walls; and the Romans, says Plutarch,
repulsed by an infinity of wounds, without seeing the place or
hand from which they came, seemed to fight in reality with the
gods.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Marcellus, though at a loss what to do, and not knowing
how to oppose the machines of Archimedes, could not, however,
forbear pleasantries upon them. &#8216;Shall we persist,&#8217; said
he to his workmen and engineers, &#8216;in making war with this
Briareus of a geometrician, who treats my galleys and sambucæ
so rudely? He infinitely exceeds the fabled giants with their
hundred hands, in his perpetual and surprising discharges upon
us.&#8217; Marcellus had reason for referring to Archimedes only;
for the Syracusans were really no more than the members of the
engines and machines of that great geometrician, who was himself
the soul of all their powers and operations. All other arms
were unemployed; for the city at that time made use of none,
either defensive or offensive, but those of Archimedes.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Marcellus at length renounced his hopes of being able to
make a breach in the place, gave over his attacks, and turned
the siege into a blockade. The Romans conceived they had no
other resource than to reduce the great number of people in the
city by famine, in cutting off all provisions that might be
brought to them either by sea or land. During the eight months
in which they besieged the city, there were no kind of stratagems
which they did not invent, nor any actions of valour
left untried, almost to the assault, which they never dared to
attempt more. So much force, on some occasions, have a single
man, and a single science, when rightly applied.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;A burning glass is spoken of, by means of which Archimedes
is said to have burned part of the Roman fleet.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;In the beginning of the third campaign, Marcellus almost
absolutely despairing of being able to take Syracuse, either by
force, because Archimedes continually opposed him with invincible
obstacles, or famine, as the Carthaginian fleet, which was
returned more numerous than before, easily threw in convoys,
deliberated whether he should continue before Syracuse to push
the siege, or turn his endeavours against Agrigentum. But
before he came to a final determination, he thought proper to
try whether he could make himself master of Syracuse by some
secret intelligence.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;This, too, having miscarried, Marcellus found himself in
new difficulties. Nothing employed his thoughts but the shame
of raising a siege, after having consumed so much time, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>sustained the loss of so many men and ships in it. An accident
supplied him with a resource, and gave new life to his hopes.
Some Roman vessels had taken one Damippus, whom Epicydes
had sent to negociate with Philip king of Macedon. The
Syracusans expressed a great desire to ransom this man, and
Marcellus was not averse to it. A place near the port Trogilus
was agreed on for the conferences concerning the ransom of the
prisoner. As the deputies went thither several times, it came
into a Roman soldier&#8217;s thoughts to consider the wall with
attention. After having counted the stones, and examined with
his eye the measure of each of them, upon a calculation
of the height of the wall, he found it to be much lower than it
was believed, and concluded, that with ladders of a moderate
size it might be easily scaled. Without loss of time he related
the whole to Marcellus. Marcellus did not neglect this advice,
and assured himself of its reality with his own eyes. Having
caused ladders to be prepared, he took the opportunity of a
festival that the Syracusans celebrated for three days in honour
of Diana, during which the inhabitants gave themselves up
entirely to rejoicing and good cheer. At the time of night
when he conceived that the Syracusans, after their debauch,
began to fall asleep, he made a thousand chosen troops, in
profound silence, advance with their ladders to the wall. When
the first got to the top without noise or tumult, the others
followed, encouraged by the boldness and success of their
leaders. These thousand soldiers, taking the advantage of the
enemy&#8217;s stillness, who were either drunk or asleep, soon scaled
the wall.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;It was then no longer time to deceive, but terrify the enemy.
The Syracusans, awakened by the noise, began to rouse, and to
prepare for action. Marcellus made all his trumpets sound
together, which so alarmed them, that all the inhabitants fled,
believing every quarter of the city in the possession of the
enemy. The strongest and best part, however, called Achradina,
was not yet taken, because separated by its walls from
the rest of the city.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;All the captains and officers with Marcellus congratulated
him upon this extraordinary success. For himself, when he
had considered from an eminence the loftiness, beauty, and
extent of that city, he is said to have shed tears, and to have
deplored the unhappy condition it was upon the point of
experiencing.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;As it was then autumn, there happened a plague, which
killed great numbers in the city, and still more in the Roman
and Carthaginian camps. The distemper was not excessive at
first, and proceeded only from the bad air and season; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>afterwards the communication with the infected, and even the
care taken of them, dispersed the contagion; from whence it
happened that some, neglected and absolutely abandoned, died
of the violence of the malady, and others received help, which
became fatal to those who brought it. Nothing was heard
night and day but groans and lamentations. At length, the
being accustomed to the evil had hardened their hearts to such
a degree, and so far extinguished all sense of compassion in
them, that they not only ceased to grieve for the dead, but left
them without interment. Nothing was to be seen every where
but dead bodies, exposed to the view of those who expected the
same fate. The Carthaginians suffered much more from it
than the others. As they had no place to retire to, they almost
all perished, with their generals Hippocrates and Himilcon.
Marcellus, from the breaking out of the disease, had brought
his soldiers into the city, where the roofs and shade was of
great relief to them; he lost, however, no inconsiderable
number of men.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Amongst those, who commanded in Syracuse, there was a
Spaniard named Mericus: him a means was found to corrupt.
He gave up the gate near the fountain Arethusa to soldiers
sent by Marcellus in the night to take possession of it. At
day-break the next morning, Marcellus made a false attack at
Achradina, to draw all the forces of the citadel and the isle
adjoining to it, to that side, and to facilitate the throwing some
troops into the isle, which would be unguarded, by some
vessels he had prepared. Every thing succeeded according to
his plan. The soldiers, whom those vessels had landed in the
isle, finding almost all the posts abandoned, and the gates by
which the garrison of the citadel had marched out against
Marcellus still open, they took possession of them after a slight
encounter.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;The Syracusans opened all their gates to Marcellus, and
sent deputies to him with instructions to demand nothing
further from him than the preservation of the lives of themselves
and their children. Marcellus having assembled his
council, and some Syracusans who were in his camp, gave his
answer to the deputies in their presence:&mdash;&#8216;That Hiero, for
fifty years, had not done the Roman people more good than
those who have been masters of Syracuse some years past had
intended to do them harm; but that their ill-will had fallen
upon their own heads, and they had punished themselves for
their violation of treaties in a more severe manner than the
Romans could have desired. That he had besieged Syracuse
during three years; not that the Roman people might reduce
it into slavery, but to prevent the chiefs of the revolters from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>continuing it under oppression. That he had undergone many
fatigues and dangers in so long a siege, but that he thought he
had made himself ample amends by the glory of having taken
that city, and the satisfaction of having saved it from the entire
ruin it seemed to deserve.&#8217; After having placed a guard upon
the treasury, and safe-guards in the houses of the Syracusans,
who had withdrawn into his camp, he abandoned the city to
be plundered by the troops. It is reported that the riches
which were pillaged in Syracuse at this time exceeded all that
could have been expected at the taking of Carthage itself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The chronicles of Syracuse<a name="FNanchor_260_269" id="FNanchor_260_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_269" class="fnanchor">260</a> commemorate endless
and bitter dissentions among the several ranks of
citizens, the destruction of liberty by tyrants, their
expulsion and re-establishment, victories over the
Carthaginians, and many noble struggles to vindicate
the rights of mankind; till the fatal hour arrived,
when the Roman leviathan swallowed all up. Inglorious
peace and insignificance were afterwards,
for many ages, the lot of Syracuse; and, probably,
the situation was an eligible one, except in times of
such governors as Verres. At length, Rome herself
fell in her turn, a prey to conquest, and barbarians
divided her ample spoils. The Vandals seized upon
Sicily; but it was soon wrested from them by Theodoric
the Goth; and at his death, fell into the hands
of the Eastern emperor. Totila afflicted Syracuse
with a long but fruitless siege: yet it was not so well
defended against the Saracens. These cruel enemies
took it twice, and exercised the most savage barbarities
on the wretched inhabitants. They kept possession
of it two hundred years, and made an obstinate
resistance against Earl Roger, in this fortress,
which was one of the last of their possessions, that
yielded to his victorious arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is truly melancholy,&#8221; says Mr. Brydone, &#8220;to
think of the dismal contrast, that its former magnificence
makes with its present meanness. The mighty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
Syracuse, the most opulent and powerful of all the
Grecian cities, which, by its own strength alone, was
able at different times to contend against all the
power of Carthage and of Rome, in which it is recorded
to have repulsed fleets of 2000 sail, and armies
of 200,000 men; and contained within its walls,
what no other city ever did before or since, fleets and
armies that were the terror of the world:&mdash;this
haughty and magnificent city is reduced even below
the consequence of the most insignificant borough.&#8221;</p>

<p>In its most flourishing state Syracuse, according
to Strabo, extended twenty-two and a half English
miles in circumference<a name="FNanchor_261_270" id="FNanchor_261_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_270" class="fnanchor">261</a>, and was divided into four
districts; each of which was, as it were, a separate
city, fortified with three citadels, and three-fold
walls.</p>

<p>Of the four cities<a name="FNanchor_262_271" id="FNanchor_262_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_271" class="fnanchor">262</a> that composed this celebrated
city, there remains only Ortygia, by much the smallest,
situated in the island of that name. It is about
two miles round. The ruins of the other three are
computed at twenty-two miles in circumference.
The walls of these are every where built with broken
marbles, covered over with engravings and inscriptions;
but most of them defaced and spoiled. The
principal remains of antiquity are a theatre and amphitheatre,
many sepulchres, the Latomie, the catacombs,
and the famous Ear of Dionysius, which it was
impossible to destroy. The Latomie now forms a
noble subterraneous garden, and is, indeed, a very
beautiful and romantic spot. The whole is hewn out
of a rock as hard as marble, composed entirely of a
concretion of gravel, shells, and other marine bodies;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>and many orange, bergamot, and fig trees, grow out of
the hard rock, where there is no mark of any soil.</p>

<p>There are many remains of temples. The Duke
of Montalbano, who has written on the antiquities
of Syracuse, reckons nearly twenty; but few of these
now are distinguishable. A few fine columns of that
of Jupiter Olympius still remain; and the temple of
Minerva (now converted into the cathedral of the city,
and dedicated to the Virgin) is almost entire.</p>

<p>There are some remains, also, of Diana&#8217;s temple,
near to the church of St. Paul; but they are not
remarkable.</p>

<p>The palace of Dionysius, his tomb, the baths of
Daphnis, and other ancient buildings, and all their
statues and paintings<a name="FNanchor_263_272" id="FNanchor_263_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_272" class="fnanchor">263</a>, have disappeared; but the
Ear, of which history speaks so loud, still remains.
It is no less a monument of the ingenuity and magnificence,
than of the cruelty of the tyrant. It
is a huge cavern, cut out of the hard rock, exactly
in the form of the human ear. The perpendicular
height of it is about eighty feet, and the length
is no less than two hundred and fifty. The cavern
was said to be so contrived, that every sound,
made in it, was collected and united into one
point as into a focus. This was called the tympanum;
and exactly opposite to it the tyrant had made a
hole, communicating with a little apartment, in which
he used to conceal himself. He applied his own ear
to this hole, and is said to have heard distinctly every
word that was spoken in the cavern below. This
apartment was no sooner finished, than he put to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>death all the workmen that had been employed in it.
He then confined all those that he suspected of being
his enemies; and by hearing their conversation
judged of their guilt, and condemned or acquitted
accordingly.</p>

<p>The holes in the rock, to which the prisoners were
chained, still remain, and even the lead and iron in
several of the holes.</p>

<p>The cathedral<a name="FNanchor_264_273" id="FNanchor_264_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_273" class="fnanchor">264</a>, now dedicated to Our Lady of the
Pillar, was the temple of Minerva, on the summit of
which her statue was fixed; holding a broad, refulgent
shield. Every Syracusan, that sailed out of the
port, was bound by his religion to carry honey,
flowers, and ashes, which he threw into the sea, the
instant he lost sight of the buckler. This was to
ensure a safe return. The temple is built in the
Doric proportions, used in the rest of Sicily. Its
exterior dimensions are one hundred and eighty-five
feet in length, and seventy-five in breadth.</p>

<p>The amphitheatre<a name="FNanchor_265_274" id="FNanchor_265_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_274" class="fnanchor">265</a> is in the form of a very eccentric
ellipse; but the theatre is so entire, that most of
the seats still remain.</p>

<p>The great harbour ran into the heart of the city,
and was called &#8220;Marmoreo,&#8221; because it was entirely
encompassed with buildings of marble. Though the
buildings are gone, the harbour exists in all its
beauty. It is capable of receiving vessels of the
greatest burden, and of containing a numerous fleet.
Although at present this harbour is entirely neglected,
it might easily be rendered a great naval and
commercial station.</p>

<p>The catacombs are a great work; not inferior
either to those of Rome or Naples, and in the same
style.</p>

<p>There was also a prison, called Latomiæ, a word
signifying a quarry. Cicero has particularly described
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>this dreadful prison, which was a cave dug out of
the solid rock, one hundred and twenty-five paces
long, and twenty feet broad, and almost one hundred
feet below the surface of the earth. Cicero, also,
reproaches Verres with imprisoning Roman citizens
in this place; which was the work of Dionysius, who
caused those to be shut up in it, who had the misfortune
to have incurred his displeasure. It is now
a noble subterranean garden.</p>

<p>The fountain of Arethusa<a name="FNanchor_266_275" id="FNanchor_266_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_275" class="fnanchor">266</a> also still exists. It
was dedicated to Diana, who had a magnificent
temple near its banks, where great festivals were
annually celebrated in honour of that goddess. It is
indeed an astonishing fountain, and rises at once out
of the earth to the size of a river: and many of the
people believe, even to this day, that it is the identical
river, Arethusa, that was said to have sunk
under ground near Olympia in Greece, and, continuing
its course five hundred or six hundred miles
below the ocean, rose again in this spot.<a name="FNanchor_267_276" id="FNanchor_267_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_276" class="fnanchor">267</a></p>

<h2>NO. XXXVIII.&mdash;THEBES.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> glory of Thebes belongs to a period, prior to
the commencement of authentic history. It is recorded
only by the divine light of poetry and tradition,
which might be suspected as fable, did not
such mighty witnesses remain to attest the truth.
A curious calculation, made from the rate of increase
of deposition by the Nile, corroborated by other
evidence, shows however that this city must have
been founded four thousand seven hundred and sixty
years ago, or two thousand nine hundred and thirty
before Christ. There are the ruins of a temple, bearing
an inscription, stating that it was founded by
Osymandyas, who reigned, according to M. Champollion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
two thousand two hundred and seventy
years before Christ.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-415a.jpg" width="500" height="306" alt="Thebes." title="" />
<div class="caption">THEBES.</div>
</div>

<p>Thebes was called, also, Diospolis, as having been
sacred to Jupiter; and Hecatompylos, on account, it
is supposed, of its having had a hundred gates.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i04">&#8220;Not all proud Thebes&#8217; unrivall&#8217;d walls contains,</span>
<span class="i0">The world&#8217;s great empress, on the Egyptian plain;</span>
<span class="i0">That spreads her conquests o&#8217;er a thousand states,</span>
<span class="i0">And pours her heroes through a hundred gates&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Two hundred horsemen, and two hundred cars,</span>
<span class="i0">From each wide portal issuing to the wars.&#8221;</span>
<span class="i10"><span class="smcap">Homer&#8217;s Iliad; Pope.</span></span>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;This epithet Hecatompylos, however,&#8221; says Mr.
Wilkinson, &#8220;applied to it by Homer, has generally
been supposed to refer to the hundred gates of its
wall of circuit; but this difficulty is happily solved
by an observation of Diodorus, that many suppose
them &#8216;to have been the propylæa of the temples,&#8217;
and that this expression rather implies a plurality,
than a definite number.&#8221;</p>

<p>Historians are unanimously agreed, that Menes
was the first king of Egypt. It is pretended, and
not without foundation, that he is the same with
Misraim, the son of Cham. Cham was the second
son of Noah. When the family of the latter, after
the attempt of building the Tower of Babel, dispersed
themselves into different countries; Cham
retired to Africa, and it was, doubtless, he who
afterwards was worshipped as a god, under the
name of Jupiter Ammon. He had four children,
Chus, Misraim, Phut, and Canaan. Chus settled
in Ethiopia, Misraim in Egypt, which generally is
called in Scripture after his name, and by that of
Cham, his father. Phut took possession of that part
of Africa which lies westward of Egypt; and Canaan,
of the country which has since borne his name.</p>

<p>Misraim is agreed to be the same as Menes, whom
all historians declare to be the first king of Egypt;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
the institutor of the worship of the gods, and of the
ceremonies of the sacrifices.</p>

<p>Some ages after him, Busiris built the city of
Thebes, and made it the seat of his empire. This
prince is not to be confounded with the Busiris who,
in so remarkable a manner, distinguished himself by
his inordinate cruelties. In respect to Osymandyas,
Diodorus gives a very particular account of many
magnificent edifices raised by him; one of which
was adorned with sculpture and paintings of great
beauty, representing an expedition against the Bactrians,
a people of Asia, whom he had invaded with
four hundred thousand foot, and twenty thousand
horse. In another part of the edifice was exhibited
an assembly of the judges, whose president wore on
his breast a picture of Truth, with her eyes shut,
and himself surrounded with books; an emphatic
emblem, denoting that judges ought to be perfectly
versed in the laws, and impartial in the administration
of them. The king, also, was painted there,
offering to the gods silver and gold, which he drew
from the mines of Egypt, amounting to the sum of
sixteen millions.</p>

<p>So old as this king&#8217;s reign, the Egyptians divided
the year into twelve months, each consisting of thirty
days; to which they added, every year, five days and
six hours. To quote the words of a well-known
writer, (Professor Heeren,) &#8220;its monuments testify
to us a time when it was the centre of the civilisation
of the human race; a civilisation, it is true,
which has not endured, but which, nevertheless,
forms one of the steps by which mankind has attained
to higher perfection.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although Thebes had greatly fallen from its
former splendour, in the time of Cambyses the
Persian it was the fury of this lawless and merciless
conqueror that gave the last blow to its grandeur,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
about 520 years before the Christian era. He pillaged
its temples, and carried away the ornaments
of gold, silver, and ivory. Before this period, no
city in the world could be compared with it in size,
beauty, and wealth; and according to the expression
of Diodorus&mdash;&#8220;The sun had never seen so magnificent
a city.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next step towards the decline and fall of this
city was, as we learn from Diodorus, the preference
given to Memphis; and the removal of the seat of
government thither, and subsequently to Sais and
Alexandria, proved as disastrous to the welfare, as
the Persian invasion had been to the splendour, of
the capital of Upper Egypt. &#8220;Commercial wealth,&#8221;
says Mr. Wilkinson, &#8220;on the accession of the Ptolemies,
began to flow through other channels. Coptos
and Apollinopolis succeeded to the lucrative trade of
Arabia; and Ethiopia no longer contributed to the
revenues of Thebes; and its subsequent destruction,
after a three years&#8217; siege, by Ptolemy Lathyrus,
struck a death-blow to the welfare and existence of
this capital, which was, thenceforth, scarcely deemed
an Egyptian city. Some few repairs, however, were
made to its dilapidated temples by Evergetes II.,
and some by the later Ptolemies. But it remained
depopulated; and at the time of Strabo&#8217;s visit, was
already divided into small and detached villages.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thebes was, perhaps, the most astonishing work
ever performed by the hand of man. In the time
of its splendour, it extended above twenty-three
miles; and upon any emergency could send into the
field seven hundred thousand men, according to
Tacitus; but Homer allows only that it could pour
through each of its hundred gates two hundred armed
men, with their chariots and horses, which makes
about forty thousand men, allowing two men to each
chariot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span></p>

<p>Though its walls were twenty-four feet in thickness,
and its buildings the most solid and magnificent;
yet, in the time of Strabo and of Juvenal,
only mutilated columns, broken obelisks, and temples
levelled with the dust, remained to mark its situation,
and inform the traveller of the desolation which
time, or the more cruel hand of tyranny, can assert
over the proudest monuments of human art.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Thebes,&#8221; says Strabo, &#8220;presents only remains of its
former grandeur, dispersed over a space eighty stadia in
length. Here are found great number of temples, in part
destroyed by Cambyses; its inhabitants have retired to small
towns, east of the Nile, where the present city is built, and
to the western shore, near Memnonium; at which place we
admired two colossal stone figures, standing on each side, the
one entire, the other in part thrown down, it has been said by
an earthquake. There is a popular opinion, that the remaining
part of this statue, towards the base, utters a sound once a
day. Curiosity leading me to examine this fact, I went thither
with &AElig;lius Gallus, who was accompanied with his numerous
friends, and an escort of soldiers. I heard a sound about six
o&#8217;clock in the morning, but dare not affirm whether it proceeded
from the base, from the colossus, or had been produced
by some person present; for one is rather inclined to suppose
a thousand different causes, than that it should be the effect
of a certain assemblage of stones.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Beyond Memnonium are the tombs of the kings, hewn
out of the rock. There are about forty, made after a marvellous
manner, and worthy the attention of travellers. Near
them are obelisks, bearing various inscriptions, descriptive of
the wealth, power, and extensive empire of those sovereigns
who reigned over Scythia, Bactriana, Judæa, and what is now
called Ionia. They also recount the various tributes those
kings had exacted, and the number of their troops, which
amounted to a million of men.&#8221;</p>

<p>We now proceed to draw from Diodorus Siculus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;The great Diospolis,&#8221; says he, &#8220;which the Greeks have named
Thebes, was six miles in circumference. Busiris, who founded
it, adorned it with magnificent edifices and presents. The
fame of its power and wealth, celebrated by Homer, has
filled the world. Never was there a city which received so
many offerings in silver, gold and ivory, colossal statues and
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>obelisks, each cut from a single stone. Four principal temples
are especially admired there: the most ancient of which was surpassingly
grand and sumptuous. It was thirteen stadia in
circumference, and surrounded by walls twenty-four feet in
thickness and forty-five cubits high. The richness and workmanship
of its ornaments were correspondent to the majesty
of the building, which many kings contributed to embellish.
The temple still is standing; but it was stripped of its silver
and gold, ivory, and precious stones, when Cambyses set fire
to all the temples of Egypt.&#8221;</p>

<p>The following account of the tomb of Osymandyas
is also from Diodorus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Ten stadia from the tombs of the kings of Thebes, is
the admirable one of Osymandyas. The entrance to it is by a
vestibule of various coloured stones, two hundred feet long,
and sixty-eight high. Leaving this we enter a square peristyle,
each side of which is four hundred feet in length.
Animals twenty-four feet high, cut from blocks of granite,
serve as columns to support the ceiling, which is composed
of marble slabs, twenty-seven feet square, and embellished
throughout by golden stars glittering on a ground of azure.
Beyond this peristyle is another entrance; and after that a
vestibule, built like the first, but containing more sculptures
of all kinds. At the entrance are three statues, formed from
a single stone by Memnon Syncite, the principal of which, representing
the king, is seated, and is the largest in Egypt. One
of its feet, exactly measured, is about seven cubits. The other
had figures supported on its knees; the one on the right, the
other on the left, are those of his mother and daughter. The
whole work is less valuable for its enormous grandeur, than for
the beauty of the sculpture, and the choice of the granite,
which, though so extensive, has neither flaw nor blemish on its
surface. The colossus bears this inscription: &#8216;I am Osymandyas,
king of kings; he who would comprehend my greatness,
and where I rest, let him destroy some one of these works.&#8217;
Beside this, is another statue of his mother, cut from a single
block of granite, thirty feet high. Three queens are sculptured
on her head, intimating that she was a daughter, wife,
and mother of a king. After this portico is a peristyle, still more
beautiful than the first; on the stones of which is engraved,
the history of the wars of Osymandyas, against the rebels of
Bactriana. The façade of the front wall exhibits this prince
attacking ramparts, at the foot of which the river flows. He
is combating advanced troops; and by his side is a terrible
lion, ardent in his defence. On the right wall are captives in
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>chains, with their hands and genitals cut off, as marks of reproach
for their cowardice. The wall on the left contains
symbolical figures of exceedingly good sculpture, descriptive of
triumphs and sacrifice of Osymandyas returning from this war.
In the centre of the peristyle, where the roof is open, an altar
was erected of a single stone of marvellous bulk and exquisite
workmanship; and at the farther wall are two colossal figures,
each hewn from a single block of marble, forty feet high,
seated on their pedestals. This admirable peristyle has three
gates, one between the two statues, and the others on each side.
These lead to an edifice two hundred feet square, the roof of
which is supported by high columns; it resembles a magnificent
theatre; several figures carved in wood, represent a tribunal
administering justice. Thirty judges are seen on one of the
walls; and in the midst of them the chief justice, with a pile
of books at his feet, and a figure of Truth, with her eyes shut,
suspended from his neck; beyond is a walk, surrounded by
edifices of various forms, in which were tables stored with all
kinds of delicious viands. In one of these, Osymandyas, clothed
in magnificent robes, offers up the gold and silver which he
annually drew from the mines of Egypt to the gods. Beneath,
the amount of this revenue, which was thirty-two million
minas of silver, was inscribed. Another building contained the
sacred library, at the entrance of which these words were read:
&#8216;Physic for the soul.&#8217; A fourth contained all the deities of
Egypt, with the king offering suitable presents to each; and
calling Osiris and the surrounding divinities to witness, he had
exercised piety towards the gods, and justice towards men.
Beside the library stood one of the finest of these edifices, and
in it twenty couches to recline on, while feasting; also the statues
of Jupiter, Juno, and Osymandyas, whose body, it is supposed,
was deposited here. Various adjoining apartments
contained representations of all the consecrated animals of
Egypt. Hence was the ascent to the sepulchre of the king;
on the summit of which was placed a circle of gold, in thickness
one cubit, and three hundred and sixty-five in circumference,
each cubit corresponding to a day in the year; and
on it was engraved the rising and setting of the stars for that
day, with such astrological indications as the superstition of
the Egyptians had affixed to them. Cambyses is said to have
carried off this circle, when he ravaged Egypt. Such, according
to historians, was the tomb of Osymandyas, which surpassed
all others as well by its wealth, as by the workmanship of the
skilful artists employed.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the whole of Upper Egypt, adjacent to each
city, numerous tombs are always found excavated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
in the neighbouring mountains. The most extensive
and highly ornamented are nearest to the base; those
of smaller dimensions, and less decorated, occupy the
middle; and the most rude and simple are situated
in the upper parts.</p>

<p>Those adjacent to Thebes are composed of extensive
galleries, twelve feet broad and twenty high,
with many lateral chambers.</p>

<p>They are ornamented with pilasters, sculptures,
stucco, and paintings; both ceilings and walls are
covered with emblems of war, agriculture, and
music; and, in some instances, with shapes of very
elegant utensils, and always representing offerings of
bread, fruit, and liquors. The colours upon the
ceilings are blue, and the figures yellow. We must,
however, refer to a fuller account:&mdash;that of Belzoni.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Gournou</span> is a tract of rocks about two miles in length,
at the foot of the Lybian mountains, on the west of Thebes,
and was the burial-place of the great &#8216;city of the hundred
gates.&#8217; Every part of these rocks is cut out by art, in the form
of large and small chambers, each of which has its separate entrance;
and, though they are very close to each other, it is seldom
that there is any communication from one to another.
I can truly say, it is impossible to give any description sufficient
to convey the smallest idea of these subterranean abodes
and their inhabitants; there are no sepulchres in any part of
the world like them; and no exact description can be given of
their interior, owing to the difficulty of visiting these recesses.
Of some of these tombs many persons cannot withstand the
suffocating air, which often causes fainting. A vast quantity of
dust rises, so fine, that it enters into the throat and nostrils,
and chokes to such a degree, that it requires great power of lungs
to resist it, and the strong effluvia of the mummies. This is
not all; the entry, or passage where the bodies are, is roughly
cut in the rocks, and the falling of the sand from the ceiling
causes it to be nearly filled up:&mdash;so that in some places, there is
not a vacancy of much more than a foot left, which must be
passed in a creeping posture on the hands and knees. Alter
getting through these passages, some of them two or three hundred
yards long, you generally find a more commodious place,
perhaps high enough to sit: but what a place of rest! Surrounded
by bodies, by heaps of mummies in all directions,
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>which, till I got accustomed to the sight, impressed me with
horror. After the exertion of entering into such a place through
a passage of sometimes six hundred yards in length, nearly
overcome, I sought a resting-place, found one, and contrived to
sit; but when my weight bore on the body of an Egyptian, it
crushed it like a band-box. I naturally had recourse to my
hands to sustain my weight, but they found no better support;
so that I sank altogether among the broken mummies with a
crash of bones, rags, and wooden cases, which raised such a
dust as kept me motionless for a quarter of an hour, waiting
till it subsided again. Once I was conducted from such a place
to another resembling it, through a passage about twenty feet
in length, and no larger than that a body could be forced
through; it was choked with mummies, and I could not pass
without putting my face in contact with that of some decayed
Egyptian; but, as the passage inclined downwards, my own
weight helped me on, and I could not avoid being covered with
bones, legs, arms, and heads; rolling from above. The purpose
of my researches was to rob the Egyptians of their papyri, of
which I found a few hidden in their breasts, under their arms,
in the space above their knees, or on the legs, and covered by
the numerous folds of cloth that envelop the body.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Nothing can more plainly distinguish the various classes
of people, than the manner of their preservation. In the
many pits that I have opened, I never saw a single mummy
standing, and found them lying regularly in horizontal rows,
and some were sunk into a cement which must have been nearly
fluid when the cases were placed on it. The lower classes were
not buried in cases: they were dried up, as it appears, after the
usual preparation. Mummies of this sort were in the proportion
of about ten to one of the better class, as nearly as I could
calculate from the quantity of both I have seen; the linen
in which they are folded is of a coarser sort and less in quantity;
they have no ornaments about them of any consequence, and
are piled up in layers, so as to fill, in a rude manner, the caves
excavated for the purpose. In general these tombs are to be
found in the lower grounds, at the foot of the mountains; they
are entered by a small aperture arched over, or by a shaft four or
five feet square, at the bottom of which are entrances into various
chambers, all choked up with mummies, many of which have
been rummaged and left in the most confused state. Among
these tombs we saw some which contained the mummies of animals
intermixed with human bodies; these were bulls, cows, sheep,
monkeys, foxes, bats, crocodiles, fishes, and birds. Idols often
occur, and one tomb was filled with nothing but cats, carefully
folded in red and white linen, the head covered by a mask made
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>of the same, and representing the cat. I have opened all these
sorts of animals. Of the bull, the calf, and the sheep, there is
no part but the head, which is covered with linen with the horns
projecting out of the cloth; the rest of the body being represented
by two pieces of wood eighteen inches wide and three
feet long, with another at the end, two feet high, to form the
breast. It is somewhat singular, that such animals are not to
be met with in the tombs of the higher sort of people, while
few or no papyri are to be found among the lower order; and if
any occur, they are only small pieces stuck on the breast with a
little gum or asphaltum, being probably all that the poor individual
could afford to himself. In those of the better classes
other objects are found. I think they ought to be divided into
several classes, and not confined to three, as is done by Herodotus
in his account of the mode of embalming. In the same
pit where I found mummies in cases, I have found others without,
and in these, papyri are most likely to be met with. I
remarked that those in cases have none. It appears to me that
those that could afford it had a case to be buried in, on which
the history of their lives was painted; and those who could not
afford a case, were contented to have their lives written on papyri,
and placed above their knees. The cases are made of
sycamore, some very plain, some richly painted with well-executed
figures; all have a human face on the lid: some of the
larger contain others within them, either of wood or plaster,
and painted; some of the mummies have garlands of flowers
and leaves of the acacia, or Sunt-tree, over their heads and
breasts. In the inside of these mummies are often found lumps
of asphaltum, sometimes weighing as much as two pounds.
Another kind of mummy I believe I may conclude to have belonged
exclusively to the priests: they are folded in a manner
totally differing from the others, and with much more care; the
bandages consist of stripes of red and white linen intermixed,
and covering the whole body, but so carefully applied, that the
form of the trunk and limbs are preserved separate, even to the
fingers and toes; they have sandals of painted leather on the
feet, and bracelets on their arms and wrists. The cases in which
these mummies are preserved, are somewhat better executed
than the rest.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;The tombs containing the better classes are of course
superior to the others; some are also more extensive than
others, having various apartments adorned with figures. It
would be impossible to describe the numerous little articles
found in them, which are well adapted to show the domestic
habits of the ancient Egyptians. It is here the smaller idols
are occasionally found, either lying on the ground, or on the
cases. Vases made of baked clay, painted over, from eight to
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>eighteen inches in size, are sometimes seen, containing embalmed
entrails; the covers represent the head of some divinity,
bearing either the human form, or that of a monkey, fox,
cat, or other animal. I met with a few of these made of
alabaster, in the tombs of the kings, but they were unfortunately
broken: a great quantity of pottery and wooden vessels
are found in some of the tombs; the ornaments, the small works
in clay in particular, are very curious. I have been fortunate
enough to find many specimens of their manufactures, among
which is leaf-gold, nearly as thin as ours; but what is singular,
the only weapon I met with was an arrow, two feet long.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;One day while causing the walls of a large tomb to be
struck with a sledge-hammer, in order to discover some hidden
chambers, an aperture, a foot and a half wide, into another
tomb, was suddenly made: having enlarged it sufficiently to
pass, we entered, and found several mummies and a great
quantity of broken cases; in an inner apartment was a square
opening, into which we descended, and at the bottom we found
a small chamber at each side of the shaft, in one of which was
a granite sarcophagus with its cover, quite perfect, but so situated,
that it would be an arduous undertaking to draw it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Among the many discoveries of the enterprising
Belzoni, was that of the Tombs of the Kings:&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;After a long survey of the western valley, I could observe
only one spot that presented the appearance of a tomb: accordingly
I set the men to work, and when they had got a little below
the surface, they came to some large stones; having removed
these, I perceived the rock had been cut on both sides, and
found a passage leading downwards, and in a few hours came
to a well-built wall of stones of various sizes, through which
we contrived to make a breach; at last on entering, we found
ourselves on a staircase, eight feet wide and ten high, at the
bottom of which were four mummies in their cases, lying flat
on the ground, and further on four more: the cases were all
painted, and one had a large covering thrown over it like a
pall. These I examined carefully, but no further discoveries
were made at this place, which appears to have been intended
for some of the royal blood.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Not fifteen yards from the last tomb I described, I
caused the earth to be opened at the foot of a steep hill, and
under a torrent which, when it rains, pours a great quantity
of water over the spot: on the evening of the second day, we
perceived the part of the rock which was cut and formed the
entrance, which was at length entirely cleared, and was found
to be eighteen feet below the surface of the ground. In about
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>an hour there was room for me to enter through a passage that
the earth had left under the ceiling of the first corridor, which
is thirty-six feet long and eight or nine wide, and when cleared,
six feet nine inches high. I perceived immediately, by the
painting on the ceiling, and by the hieroglyphics in bas-relief,
that this was the entrance into a large and magnificent tomb.
At the end of the corridor, I came to a staircase twenty-three
feet long, and of the same breadth as the corridor, with a door
at the bottom, twelve feet high; this led to another corridor
thirty-seven feet long, and of the same width and height as the
former one, each side, and the ceiling sculptured with hieroglyphics
and painted; but I was stopped from further progress
by a large pit at the other end, thirty feet deep and twelve
wide. The upper part of this was adorned with figures, from the
wall of the passage up to the ceiling; the passages from the
entrance, all the way to this pit, were inclined at an angle of
about eighteen degrees. On the opposite side of the pit, facing
the passage, a small opening was perceived, two feet wide, and
two feet six inches high, and a quantity of rubbish at the
bottom of the wall; a rope, fastened to a piece of wood that
was laid across the passage, against the projections which form
a kind of door, appears to have been used for descending into
the pit, and from the small aperture on the other side hung
another, for the purpose, doubtless, of ascending again; but
these and the wood crumbled to dust on touching them, from
the damp arising from the water which drained into the pit
down the passages. On the following day we contrived a bridge
of two beams to cross the pit by, and found the little aperture
to be an opening forced through a wall, which had entirely
closed the entrance, and which had been plastered over and
painted, so as to give the appearance of the tomb having ended
at the pit, and of there having been nothing beyond it. The
rope in the inside of the wall, having been preserved from the
damp, did not fall to pieces, and the wood to which it was
attached was in good preservation. When we had passed
through the little aperture, we found ourselves in a beautiful
hall, twenty-seven feet six inches by twenty-five feet ten
inches, in which were four pillars, three feet square. At the
end of this room, which I shall call the entrance hall, and
opposite the aperture, is a large door, from which three
steps lead down into a chamber with two pillars, four feet
square, the chamber being twenty-eight by twenty-five feet;
the walls were covered with figures, which, though in outline
only, were as fine and perfect as if drawn only the
day before. On the left of the aperture a large staircase of
eighteen steps, descended from the entrance-hall into a corridor,
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
thirty-six feet by seven wide; and we perceived that the
paintings became more perfect as we advanced further; the
figures are painted on a white ground, and highly varnished.
At the end of this ten steps led us into another, seventeen feet
by eleven, through which we entered a chamber, twenty feet
by fourteen, adorned in the most splendid manner by <i>basso-relievos</i>,
painted like the rest. Standing in this chamber, the
spectator sees himself surrounded by representations of the
Egyptian gods and goddesses. Proceeding further, we entered
another large hall, twenty-eight feet square, with two rows of
pillars, three on each side, in a line with the walls of the corridors;
at each side is a small chamber, each about ten or
eleven feet square. At the end of this hall we found a large
saloon, with an arched roof or ceiling, thirty-two feet by
twenty-seven; on the right was a small chamber, roughly cut,
and obviously left unfinished; and on the left there is another,
twenty six by twenty-three feet, with two pillars in it. It had
a projection of three feet all round it, possibly intended to
contain the articles necessary for the funeral ceremonies; the
whole was beautifully painted like the rest. At the same end
of the room we entered by a large door into another chamber,
forty-three feet by seventeen, with four pillars in it, one of
which had fallen down; it was covered with white plaster
where the rock did not cut smoothly, but there were no paintings
in it. We found the carcass of a bull embalmed with
asphaltum, and also, scattered in various places, an immense
quantity of small wooden figures of mummies, six or eight
inches long, and covered with asphaltum to preserve them;
there were some others of fine baked earth, coloured blue, and
highly varnished. On each side of the two little rooms were
some wooden statues, standing erect, four feet high, with a
circular hollow inside, as if to contain a roll of papyrus, which
I have no doubt they once did. In the centre of the saloon was
a <span class="smcap">SARCOPHAGUS</span> of the finest oriental alabaster, nine feet five
inches long, and three feet seven wide; it is only two inches
thick, and consequently transparent when a light is held within
it; it is minutely sculptured, both inside and out, with several
hundred figures, not exceeding two inches in length, representing,
as I suppose, the whole of the funeral procession and
ceremonies relating to the deceased. The cover had been
taken out, and we found it broken in several pieces in digging
before the first entrance: this sarcophagus was over a staircase
in the centre of the saloon, which communicated with a subterraneous
passage, leading downwards, three hundred feet in
length. At the end of this we found a great quantity of bats&#8217;
dung, which choked it up, so that we could go no further
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>without digging; it was also nearly filled up by the falling in
of the upper part. One hundred feet from the entrance is a
staircase, in good preservation, but the rock below changes its
substance. This passage proceeds in a south-west direction
through the mountain. I measured the distance from the
entrance, and also the rocks above, and found that the passage
reaches nearly half-way through the mountain to the upper
part of the valley. I have reason to suppose that this passage
was used as another entrance; but this could not be after the
person was buried there; for, at the bottom of the stairs, under
the sarcophagus, a wall had been built, which entirely closed
this communication; hence it should appear, that this tomb
had been opened again with violence, after all the precautions
mentioned had been taken to conceal the existence of the
greater part of it; and as these had been carefully and skilfully
done, it is probable that the intruder must have had a guide
who was acquainted with the place.&#8221;</p>

<p>The rich alabaster sarcophagus, mentioned above, is
now in the Soane Museum, Lincoln&#8217;s-inn-fields, London,
and remains altogether unrivalled in beauty and
curiosity. How it came there is thus described by
Sir John Soane:&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;This marvellous effort of human industry and perseverance
is supposed to be at least three thousand years old. It is of
one piece of alabaster, between nine and ten feet in length, and
is considered of pre-eminent interest, not only as a work of
human skill and labour, but as illustrative of the customs,
arts, religion, and government of a very ancient and learned
people. The surface of this monument is covered externally
and internally with hieroglyphics, comprehending a written,
language, which it is to be hoped the labour of modern literati
will one day render intelligible. With no inconsiderable
expense and difficulty this unique monument was transferred
from Egypt to England, and placed in the British Museum, to
the trustees of which it was offered for two thousand pounds.
After which negotiation, the idea of purchasing it for our
national collection was relinquished; when it was offered to
me at the same price, which offer I readily accepted, and
shortly after I had the pleasure of seeing this splendid relic of
Egyptian magnificence safely deposited in a conspicuous part
of my museum.&#8221;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;On entering the sepulchral chamber,&#8221; says a writer,
giving an account of the Soane collection, &#8220;notwithstanding
intense anxiety to behold a work so unique and so celebrated
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>as the Belzoni sarcophagus, I confess that the place in which
this monument of antiquity is situated became the overpowering
attraction. Far above, and on every side, were concentrated
the most precious relics of architecture and sculpture, disposed
so happily as to offer the charm of novelty, the beauty of
picturesque design, and that sublimity resulting from a sense
of veneration, due to the genius and the labours of the &#8216;mighty
dead.&#8217; The light admitted from the dome appeared to descend
with a discriminating effect, pouring its brightest beams on
those objects most calculated to benefit by its presence.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;The more,&#8221; says the same writer, speaking of the sarcophagus
itself, &#8220;we contemplate this interesting memorial of
antiquity and regal magnificence, the more our sense of its
value rises in the mind. We consider the beauty and scarcity
of the material, its transparency, the rich and mellow hue,
the largeness of the original block, the adaptation of its form
to the purpose, which was unquestionably to receive a body
inclosed in numerous wrappings, and doubly cased, according
to the custom of the Egyptians. We then examine the carving
of innumerable figures, doubting not that the history of a life
fraught with the most striking events is here recorded; gaze
on the beautiful features of the female form sculptured at the
bottom of the sarcophagus, and conclude it to be that of the
goddess Isis, the elongated eye and the delicate foot closely
resembling those drawings of her, given by the learned Montfaucon;
and repeat the exclamation of Belzoni, when he
declared that the day on which he found this treasure was the
happiest of his life.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Viewed by lamp-light, the effect of this chamber is still
more impressive; for, seen by this medium, every surrounding
object, however admirable in itself, becomes subservient to the
sarcophagus. The ancient, the splendid, the wonderful sarcophagus
is before us, and all else are but accessories to its
dignity and grandeur. A mingled sense of awe, admiration, and
delight pervades our faculties, and is even oppressive in its
intensity, yet endearing in its associations.&#8221;</p>

<p>In respect to the tomb, in which this splendid
monument was discovered, Belzoni, on his arrival in
England, constructed and exhibited a perfect facsimile
of it, which many of our readers will, doubtless,
remember having seen.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;The &#8216;Tombs of the Kings,&#8217; as their name implies<a name="FNanchor_268_277" id="FNanchor_268_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_277" class="fnanchor">268</a>, are the
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>sepulchres in which are deposited the earthly remains of the
ancient Egyptian monarchs who reigned at Thebes; they are
called by some <i>Babor</i>, or <i>Biban el Molook</i>&mdash;a traditional appellation,
signifying the Gate or Gates of the Kings, which is by
others applied to the narrow gorge at the entrance of the valley
in which they are situated. This valley, as Champollion remarks,
&#8216;is the veritable abode of death; not a blade of grass,
or a living being is to be found there, with the exception of
jackals and hyænas, who, at a hundred paces from our residence,
devoured last night the ass which had served to carry
my servant Barabba Mohammed, whilst his keeper was agreeably
passing the night of Ramazan in our kitchen, which is
established in a royal tomb entirely ruined.&#8217;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;It would be unnecessary, were it possible, to give a detailed
account of these tombs, or of the sculptures which they contain,
and of which our interpretation is very limited, because
they often refer to Egyptian mysteries of which we have but
a scanty knowledge. The tomb, which of all others stands preeminently
conspicuous, as well for the beauty of its sculptures
as the state of its preservation, is undoubtedly that discovered
and opened by Belzoni. It has been deprived within a few
years of one of its chief ornaments. &#8216;I have not forgotten,&#8217;
says Champollion, in his twenty-second letter, &#8216;the Egyptian
Museum of the Louvre in my explorations; I have gathered
monuments of all sizes, and the smallest will not be found the
least interesting. Of the larger class I have selected, out of
thousands, three or four mummies remarkable for peculiar
decorations, or having Greek inscriptions; and next, the most
beautiful coloured bas-relief in the royal tomb of Menephtha
the First (Ousirei), at Biban-el-Molouk; it is a capital specimen,
of itself worth a whole collection: it has caused me much
anxiety, and will certainly occasion me a dispute with the
English at Alexandria, who claim to be the lawful proprietors
of the tomb of Ousirei, discovered by Belzoni at the expense of
Mr. Salt. In spite, however, of this fine pretension, one of
two things shall happen; either my bas-relief shall reach Toulon,
or it shall go to the bottom of the sea, or the bottom of
the Nile, rather than fall into the hands of others; my mind
is made up on that point!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>No dispute, however, took place, and the bas-relief
is now in the museum for which it was destined.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Nearly two thousand years ago, these tombs were an
object of wonder and curiosity, and used to attract visiters from
different parts of the earth as they now do. It was the practice
even then for many of those who beheld them to leave
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>some memorial of their visit behind, in the shape of an inscription
commemorating the date at which they &#8216;saw and wondered,&#8217;
to use the expression which is commonly found among them.
Some of these inscriptions are curious: one of them is to the
following effect: &#8216;<i>I, the Dadouchos (literally Torch-bearer),
of the most sacred Eleusinian mysteries, Nisagoras of Athens,
having seen these syringes (as the tombs were commonly
called), a very long time after the divine Plato of Athens, have
wondered and given thanks to the God and to the most pious
King Constantine, who has procured me this favour.</i>&#8217; The
tomb in which this was written seems to have been generally
admired above all others, though, as Mr. Wilkinson tells us,
one morose old gentleman of the name of Epiphanius declares
that &#8216;he saw nothing to admire but the stone,&#8217; meaning the
alabaster sarcophagus. There are many other inscriptions:
some afford internal evidence of their dates, and among them
are four relating to the years 103, 122, 147, and 189 of our
era.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;A great many of the painted sculptures, which are found in
these tombs, relate to the idolatrous worship of the ancient
Egyptians, and the rites and ceremonies which they practised
in connexion with it<a name="FNanchor_269_278" id="FNanchor_269_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_278" class="fnanchor">269</a>. But besides these, there are others
which afford us a vast quantity of interesting information upon
the subjects of their domestic usages and every-day life. In
one chamber are depicted the operations of preparing and
dressing meat, boiling the cauldron, making bread, lighting the
fire, fetching water, &amp;c. Another presents scenes in a garden,
where a boy is beaten for stealing fruit; a canal and pleasure
boats; fruit and flowers; the mechanical processes of various
arts, such as sculpture, painting, the mixing of colours, &amp;c.
In the Harper&#8217;s Tomb, (so called from there being among the
bas-reliefs figures of a man playing upon an instrument resembling
a harp,) which was first visited by Bruce, there are some
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>curious illustrations of the furniture which was in use among the
Egyptians; tables, chairs, and sideboards, patterns of embossed
silk and chintz, drapery with folds and fringe are there
to be seen, precisely such, we are told, as were used in our own
country some years ago when Egyptian furniture was in fashion.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;The &#8216;Tombs of the Kings&#8217; bring many allusions of Scripture
to the mind, as is remarked by Mr. Jowett, as in the passages
of Mark v. 2, 3, 5, and particularly of Isaiah xxii. 16.
&#8216;<i>What hast thou here, and whom hast thou here, that thou
hast hewed thee out a sepulchre here, as he that heweth
him out a sepulchre on high, and that graveth an habitation
for himself on a rock?</i>&#8217;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Another passage of the same prophet might be applied to
the pride which the tenants of these magnificent abodes took in
resting as magnificently in death as they had done in life; he
tells us (xiv. 18), &#8216;<i>All the kings of the nations, even all of
them, lie in glory, every one in his own house.</i>&#8217;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;The mystical sculptures upon the walls of the chambers
within these sepulchres, cannot be better described than in the
words of Ezekiel, (viii. 8, 10): &#8216;<i>Then said he unto me, Son
of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had digged in the
wall, behold, a door; and he said unto me, Go in, and behold
the wicked abominations that they do here. So I went in,
and saw; and, behold, every form of creeping things, and
abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel,
pourtrayed upon the wall round about.</i>&#8217;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;&#8216;The Israelites,&#8217; remarks Mr. Jowett, &#8216;were but copyists;
the master sketches are to be seen in all the ancient
temples and tombs of Egypt.&#8217; These are the places in which
the dead bodies of the inhabitants of ancient Thebes were deposited
many ages ago; and notwithstanding the havoc which,
during many years, has been made among them, the stores of
mummies which they contain would almost appear to be inexhaustible;
indeed, as a modern writer expresses it, it would scarcely
be an exaggeration to say that the mountains are merely roofs
over the masses of mummies within them. The coffins, which
are made of sycamore-wood, serve as fuel to the Arabs of the
whole neighbourhood. &#8216;At first,&#8217; says Mrs. Lushington, &#8216;I did
not relish the idea of my dinner being dressed with this resurrection
wood, particularly as two or three of the coffin lids, which
were in the shape of human figures, were usually to be seen
standing upright against the tree under which the cook was
performing his operations, staring with their large eyes as if in
astonishment at the new world upon which they had opened.&#8217;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;The miserable beings who have fixed their dwellings in
these cavern tombs, are as little civillized as could be expected;
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>our female traveller describes them as having a wild and resolute
appearance. &#8216;Every man was at this time (1828) armed
with a spear, to resist, it was said, the compulsory levies of the
Pacha, who found it vain to attack them in their fastnesses. I,
who was so delighted with the beauty and peace of our new
abode, felt quite disturbed to discover that the very spot where
we encamped four years before, witnessed the massacre of many
hundreds of Arabs, then in resistance against this recruiting
system, and who were blown from guns, or shot, while endeavouring
to make their escape by swimming across the river.
The poor people, however, behaved with civility to us, and I
felt no apprehension at going among them with a single companion,
or even alone. To be sure we were obliged to take
especial care of our property, for which purpose the chief of
Luxor assisted us by furnishing half-a-dozen men to watch by
night round the encampment. Nevertheless, once after I had
gone to sleep, I was awakened by the extinguishing of the light,
and felt my little camp-bed raised up by a man creeping underneath;
he fled on my crying out, and escaped the pursuit, as
he had the vigilance, of our six protectors.&#8217;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;The feelings occasioned by the sight of the numerous fragments
of mummies which are to be found scattered in every
direction in the neighbourhood of these tombs, must be to one
of a reflective cast of mind peculiarly affecting. The Rev. Mr.
Jowett, after speaking of his ascent to the top of the Libyan
mountains, &#8216;which command a magnificent view of the winding
of the Nile, and the plain of the hundred-gated Thebes,&#8217;
says, &#8216;as we were descending the other side of the mountain,
we came suddenly on a part where thirty or forty mummies lay
scattered in the sand,&mdash;the trunk of the body filled with pitch,
and the limbs swathed in exceeding long clothes. The forty
days spent in embalming these mortal bodies, (Genesis 1. 3.) thus
give us a sight of some of our fellow-creatures who inhabited
these plains more than three thousand years ago. How solemn
the reflection that their disembodied spirits have been so long
waiting to be united again to their reanimated body! and that
this very body which, notwithstanding its artificial preservation,
we see to be a body of humiliation, will on its great change become
incorruptible and immortal.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The following observations are by Mr. Browne:&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;The massy and magnificent forms of the ruins that remain
of ancient Thebes, the capital of Egypt, the city of Jove, the
city with a hundred gates, must inspire every intelligent spectator
with awe and admiration. Diffused on both sides of the
Nile, their extent confirms the classical observations, and
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>Homer&#8217;s animated description rushes into the memory:&mdash;&#8216;Egyptian
Thebes, in whose palaces vast wealth is stored;
from each of whose hundred gates issue two hundred warriors,
with their horses and chariots.&#8217; These venerable ruins, probably
the most ancient in the world, extend for about three
leagues in length along the Nile. East and west they reach
to the mountains, a breadth of about two leagues and a half.
The river is here about three hundred yards broad. The circumference
of the ancient city must therefore have been about
twenty-seven miles. In sailing up the Nile, the first village
you come to within the precincts is <i>Kourna</i>, on the west, where
there are few houses, the people living mostly in the caverns.
Next is <i>Abu-Hadjadj</i>, a village, and <i>Karnak</i>, a small district,
both on the east. Far the largest portion of the city stood on
the eastern side of the river. On the south-west <i>Medinet-Abu</i>
marks the extremity of the ruins; for Arment, which is
about two leagues to the south, cannot be considered as a
part.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;In describing the ruins, we shall begin with the most considerable,
which are on the east of the Nile. The chief is the
Great Temple, an oblong square building, of vast extent, with
a double colonnade, one at each extremity. The massy columns
and walls are covered with hieroglyphics, a labour truly
stupendous. 1. The Great Temple stands in the district called
<i>Karnak</i>. 2. Next in importance is the temple at <i>Abu-Hadjadj</i>.
3. Numerous ruins, avenues marked with remains of sphinxes,
&amp;c. On the west side of the Nile appear, 1. Two colossal
figures, apparently of a man and woman, formed of a calcareous
stone like the rest of the ruins. 2. Remains of a large temple,
with caverns excavated in the rock. 3. The magnificent edifice
styled the <i>Palace of Memnon</i>. Some of the columns are
about forty feet high, and about nine and a half in diameter.
The columns and walls are covered with hieroglyphics. This
stands at <i>Kourna</i>. 4. Behind the palace is the passage styled
Bibân-el-Molûk, leading up the mountain. At the extremity
of this passage, in the sides of the rock, are the celebrated
caverns known as the sepulchres of the ancient kings. Several
of these sepulchres have been described by Pococke, with sufficient
minuteness; he has even given plans of them. But in
conversation with persons at Assiût, and in other parts of
Egypt, I was always informed that they had not been discovered
till within the last thirty years, when a son of Shech
Hamâm, a very powerful chief of the Arabs, who governed all
the south of Egypt from Achmîm to Nubia, caused four of
them to be opened, in expectation of finding treasure.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;They had probably been rifled in very ancient times; but
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>how the memory of them should have been lost remains to be
explained. One of those which I visited exactly answers Dr.
Pococke&#8217;s description; but the other three appear materially
different from any of his plans. It is, therefore, possible that
some of those which he saw have been gradually closed up by
the sand, and that the son of Hamâm had discovered others.
They are cut into the free-stone rock, in appearance, upon one
general plan, though differing in parts. First, a passage of
some length, then a chamber; a continuation of the first passage
turns abruptly to the right, where is the large sepulchral
chamber, with a sarcophagus of red granite in the midst.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the second part of the passage of the largest are several
cells or recesses on both sides. In these appear the chief
paintings, representing the mysteries, which, as well as the
hieroglyphics covering all the walls, are very fresh. I particularly
observed the two harpers described by Bruce; but his
engraved figures seem to be from memory. The French merchants
at Kahira informed me that he brought with him two
Italian artists; one was Luigi Balugani, a Bolognese, the other
Zucci, a Florentine.&#8221;</p>

<p class="small">The edifice at Luxor<a name="FNanchor_270_279" id="FNanchor_270_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_279" class="fnanchor">270</a> was principally the work of two
Egyptian monarchs,&mdash;Amunoph the Third, who ascended
the throne 1430 years before the Christian era, and Rameses
the Second&mdash;the Great, as he is surnamed,&mdash;whose era has
been fixed at 1500 or 1350 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span> The <i>Amenophium</i>, as the
more ancient part erected by the former is called, comprises
all that extends from the river on the south up to the
great court; a colonnade, together with a propyla which
bound it on the north, is thus a portion of it. The great
court itself, with the propyla forming the grand entrance
into the whole building, and the obelisks, colossal statues, &amp;c.,
was the work of Rameses the Second, and is sometimes called
the <i>Rameseium</i>; under this appellation, however, it must not
be confounded with the great monument of the same monarch
on the western side of the river. As this great edifice is very
near the bank of the river where it forms an angle, the soil is
supported by a solid stone wall, from which is thrown out a
jetty of massive and well-cemented brick, fifty yards in length,
and seven in width. Mr. Wilkinson says that it is of the late
era of the Ptolemies, or Cæsars, since blocks bearing the sculpture
of the former have been used in its construction; and the
same gentleman communicates the unpleasant intelligence that
the river having formed a recess behind it, threatens to sweep
away the whole of its solid masonry, and to undermine the
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>foundations of the temple itself. This jetty formed a small
port, for the convenience of boats navigating the river. Mr.
Hamilton says that its ruins very much resemble the fragments
of the bridge called that of Caligula in the Bay of Baiæ; which
is now generally believed to have been a pier for the purposes
of trade. Dr. Richardson considered the workmanship of the
embankment to be entirely Roman; and he suggests that the
temple at Luxor was probably built on the banks of the Nile for
the convenience of sailors and wayfaring men; where, without
much loss of time they might stop, say their prayers, present
their offerings, and bribe the priests for promises of future
success.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;The entrance,&#8221; says Denon, &#8220;of the village of Luxor
affords a striking instance of beggary and magnificence. What
a gradation of ages in Egypt is offered by this single scene!
What grandeur and simplicity in the bare inspection of this
one mine! It appears to me to be at the same time the most
picturesque group, and the most speaking representation of the
history of those times. Never were my eyes or my imagination
so forcibly struck as by the sight of this monument. I
often came to meditate on this spot, to enjoy the past and the
present; to compare the successive generations of inhabitants,
by their respective works, which were before my eye, and to
store in my mind volumes of materials for future meditations.
One day the sheik of the village accosted me, and asked if it
was the French or the English who had erected these monuments,
and this question completed my reflections.&#8221;</p>

<p>Every spot of ground, intervening between the
walls and columns, is laid out in plantations of corn
and olives, inclosed by mud walls.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;We have little reason to suppose<a name="FNanchor_271_280" id="FNanchor_271_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_280" class="fnanchor">271</a>, that when Egypt formed
a part of the Eastern empire, its former capital was at all
raised from its fallen condition; and we have, unfortunately,
but too much reason to conclude, that under the dominion of
the Arabian caliphs, it sank yet deeper into desolation, and
the destruction of its monuments was continued still by the
same agency which had all along worked their ruin,&mdash;the hand
of man. Though we have no distinct account of the injuries
inflicted on it in this period, we may infer their extent, and
the motives which operated to produce them, from the following
remarks of Abdallatif, an Arabian physician of Bagdad,
who wrote a description of Egypt in the fourteenth century.
He tells us, that formerly the sovereigns watched with care
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>over the preservation of the ancient monuments remaining in
Egypt; &#8216;but, in our time,&#8217; he adds, &#8216;the bridle has been unloosed
from men, and no one takes the trouble to restrain their
caprices, each being left to conduct himself as to him should
seem best. When they have perceived monuments of colossal
grandeur, the aspect of those monuments has inspired them
with terror; they have conceived foolish and false ideas of the
nature of these remains of antiquity. Every thing, which had
the appearance of design, has been in their eyes but a signal of
hidden treasure; they have not been able to see an aperture in
a mountain, without imagining it to be a road leading to some
repository of riches. A colossal statue has been to them but
the guardian of the wealth deposited at its feet, and the implacable
avenger of all attempts upon the security of his store.
Accordingly, they have had recourse to all sorts of artifice to
destroy and pull down these statues; they have mutilated the
figures, as if they hoped by such means to attain their object,
and feared that a more open attack would bring ruin upon
themselves; they have made openings, and dug holes in the
stones, not doubting them to be so many strong coffers filled
with immense sums; and they have pierced deep, too, in
the clefts of mountains, like robbers penetrating into houses
by every way but the doors, and seizing eagerly any opportunity
which they think known only to themselves.&#8217; This is
the secret of much of the devastation which has been worked
among the monuments of ancient Egypt.&#8221;</p>

<p>The village of Luxor<a name="FNanchor_272_281" id="FNanchor_272_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_281" class="fnanchor">272</a> is built on the site of the
ruins of a temple, not so large as that of Karnac,
but in a better state of preservation, the masses not
having as yet fallen through time, and by the pressure
of their own weight. The most colossal parts consist
of fourteen columns, of nearly eleven feet in
diameter, and of two statues of granite at the outer
gate, buried up to the middle of the arms, and having
in front of them the two largest and best preserved
obelisks known. They are rose-coloured, are still
seventy feet above the ground, and to judge by the
depth to which the figures seem to be covered, about
thirty feet more may be reckoned to be concealed
from the eye; making in all one hundred feet for their
height. Their preservation is perfect; and the hieroglyphics
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
with which they are covered being cut
deep, and in relief at the bottom, show the bold
hand of a master, and a beautiful finish. The
gravers, which could touch such hard materials,
must have been of an admirable temper; and the
machines to drag such enormous blocks from the
quarries, to transport them thither, and to set them
upright, together with the time required for the
labour, surpass all conception.</p>

<p>The temple is very near the river, says another
writer, and there is a good ancient jetty, well built
of bricks. The entrance is through a magnificent
gateway facing the north, two hundred feet in front,
and fifty-seven feet high, above the present level of
the soil. Before the gateway, and between the obelisks,
are two colossal statues of red granite; from
the difference of the dresses, it is judged that one
was a male, the other a female, figure. They are
nearly of equal sizes. Though buried in the ground
to the chest, they still measure twenty-one or twenty-two
feet from thence to the top of the mitres.</p>

<p>The gateway is filled with remarkable sculptures,
which represent the triumph of some ancient monarch
of Egypt over an Asiatic enemy; and which we find
repeated both on other monuments of Thebes, and
partly, also, on some of the monuments of Nubia.
This event appears to have formed an epoch in
Egyptian history, and to have furnished materials
both for the historian and the sculptor, like the war
of Troy to the Grecian poet. The whole length of
this temple is about eight hundred feet.</p>

<p>In speaking of the gate of this temple, which is
now become that of the village of Luxor, Denon
remarks:&mdash;&#8220;Nothing can be more grand, and, at the
same time, more simple, than the small number of
objects of which this entrance is composed. No city
whatever makes so proud a display at its appearance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
as this wretched village; the population of which
consists of two or three thousand souls, who have
taken up their abode on the roofs and beneath the
galleries of this temple, which has, nevertheless, the
air of being in a manner uninhabited.&#8221;</p>

<p>The following observations, in regard to the sculptures
at Luxor, are from the Saturday Magazine:&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;On the front of the great propyla, which form the principal
entrance at Luxor, are a series of sculptures which have
excited the wonder of all who have ever seen them. They are
spoken of as being entitled to rank very high among works of
ancient art; as Mr. Hamilton remarks in his admirable description
of them, they far surpass all the ideas which till they
were examined had been formed of the state of the arts in
Egypt at the era to which they must be attributed. They are
cut in a peculiar kind of relief, and are apparently intended to
commemorate some victory gained by an ancient monarch of
Egypt over a foreign enemy. The moment of the battle
chosen, is when the hostile troops are driven back in their
fortress, and the Egyptians are evidently to be soon masters of
the citadel.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;The conqueror, behind whom is borne aloft the royal
standard, in the shape of the Doum, or Theban palm-leaf, is of
colossal size: that is, far larger than all the other warriors,
standing up in a car drawn by two horses. His helmet is
adorned with a globe with a serpent on each side. He is in
the act of shooting an arrow from a bow which is full stretched;
around him are quivers, and at his feet is a lion in the act of
rushing forward. There is a great deal of life and spirit in the
form and attitude of the horses, which are in full gallop,
feathers waving over their heads, and the reins lashed round the
body of the conqueror. Under the wheels of the car, and
under the horses&#8217; hoofs and bellies, are crowds of the slain;
some stretched on the ground, others falling. On the enemy&#8217;s
side, horses in full speed with empty cars,&mdash;others heedless of
the rein, and all at last rushing headlong down a precipice into
a broad and deep river which washes the walls of the town.
The expression is exceedingly good; and nowhere has the artist
shown more skill than in two groups, in one of which the horses
having arrived at the edge of the precipice, instantly fall down;
and the driver clinging with one hand to the car, the reins and
whip falling from the other,&mdash;his body, trembling with despair,
is about to be hurled over the backs of the horses. In the
other, the horses still find a footing on the side of the hill, and
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>are hurrying forward their drivers to inevitable destruction;
these throw themselves back upon the car in vain. Some that
are yet unwounded pray for mercy on their knees, and others
in their flight cast behind a look of anxious entreaty; their
limbs, their eyes, and their hands, sufficiently declare their
fears. The breathless horses are admirable,&mdash;whether fainting
from loss of blood, or rearing up and plunging in the excess of
torture. Immediately in front of the conqueror are several
cars in full speed for the walls of the town; but even in these
the charioteers and men-of-war are not safe from the arrows
shot from his unerring bow, and when wounded they look back
on their pursuer as they fall. Further on, more fortunate
fugitives are passing the river; in which are mingled horses,
chariots, arms, and men, expressed in the most faithful manner,
floating or sunk. Some have already reached the opposite
bank where their friends, who are drawn up in order of battle,
but venture not to go out to the fight, drag them to the shore.
Others, having escaped by another road, are entering the gates
of the town amid the shrieks and lamentation of those within.
Towers, ramparts, and battlements, are crowded with inhabitants,
who are chiefly bearded old men and women. A party
of the former are seen sallying forth, headed by a youth whose
different dress, and high turban, mark him out as some distinguished
chieftain. On each side of the town are large bodies
of infantry, and a great force of chariots issuing out of the gates,
and advancing seemingly by different routes to attack the
besiegers.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;The impetuosity, with which the hero of the picture has
moved, has already carried him far beyond the main body of
his own army, and he is there alone amid the dying and the
slain&mdash;victims of his valour and prowess. Behind this scene,
the two lines of the enemy join their forces, and attack in a body
the army of the invaders, which advances to meet them in a
regular line. &#8216;Besides the peculiarities of the incidents recorded
in this interesting piece of sculpture,&#8217; says Mr. Hamilton,
&#8216;we evidently traced a distinction between the short
dresses of the Egyptians and the long robes of their Oriental
enemies; whether Indians, Persians, or Bactrians; the uncovered
and the covered heads; the different forms of the cars,
of which the Egyptian contains two, and the others three
warriors; and above all, the difference of the arms.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;At one extremity of the west wing of the gateway, the
beginning of this engagement appears to be represented; the
same monarch being seen at the head of his troops, advancing
against the double line of the enemy, and first breaking their
ranks. At the other extremity of the same wing the conqueror
is seated on his throne after the victory, holding a sceptre in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>his left hand, and enjoying the cruel spectacle of eleven of
the principal chieftains among his captives lashed together in a
row, with a rope about their necks: the foremost stretches out
his arms for pity, and in vain implores a reprieve from the fate
of his companions: close to him is the twelfth, on his knees,
just going to be put to death by the hands of two executioners.
Above them is the captive sovereign, tied with his hands behind
him to a car, to which two horses are harnessed; these are
checked from rushing onward by the attendant, till the monarch
shall mount and drag behind him the unfortunate victim of his
triumphs. Behind the throne different captives are suffering
death in various ways; some held by the executioner by the
hair of their head; others dragged by chariots or slain by the
arrow or the scimitar. There is then the conqueror&#8217;s camp,
round which are placed his treasures, and where the servants
prepare a feast to celebrate his victory.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;We have described these sculptures at length, because they
are undoubtedly one of the greatest of the many wonders of
Thebes, and because in no other manner could we convey to
our readers a proper notion of their merits.&#8221;</p>

<p>The following observations are by Lord Lindsay:&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;We visited the Temples of Luxor and Carnac. The
former is a most magnificent pile, architecturally considered,
but otherwise the least interesting of the four
great temples of Thebes. You originally entered between
four gigantic statues of Rameses the Great, and two superb
obelisks, of which one only remains;&mdash;the French have carried
off his brother, and every lover of antiquity must regret their
separation. The obelisks, statues, and pyramidal towers, were
additions by Rameses to the original edifice, founded by Amunoph
the Third. From the propyla and obelisks of this temple
an avenue, guarded by sphinxes, facing each other, extended
northwards, to the great temple of Jupiter Ammon at Carnac;
meeting it at right angles, the latter extending from west to
east. The road we followed lay nearer the river, and led us
through a comparatively small temple of Isis, that would have
detained us longer in a less attractive neighbourhood, into the
great court of Jupiter Ammon&#8217;s temple, the noblest ruin at
Thebes. A stupendous colonnade, of which one pillar only
remains erect, once extended across this court, connecting the
western propylon or gate of entrance, built by Sesostris, with
that at its eastern extremity, leading to the grand hall of
Osirei, and the sanctuary. We ascended the former;&mdash;the
avenue of sphinxes, through which the god returned, in solemn
procession, to his shrine at Carnac, after his annual visit to
the Libyan suburb, ascends to it from the river,&mdash;the same
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>avenue traversed age after age by the conqueror, the poet, the
historian, the lawgiver, the philosopher,&mdash;Sesostris, Cambyses,
Homer, Herodotus, Thales, Anaxagoras, Solon, Pythagoras,
Plato,&mdash;and now the melancholy song of an Arab boy was the
only sound that broke the silence; but that poor boy was the
representative of an older and a nobler race than that of
the Pharaohs. Long did we gaze on the scene around and
below us&mdash;utter, awful desolation! Truly, indeed, has NO
been &#8216;rent asunder!&#8217; The towers of the second or eastern
propylon are mere heaps of stones, &#8216;poured down&#8217;&mdash;as prophecy
and modern travellers describe the foundations of Samaria&mdash;into
the court on one side, and the great hall on the
other;&mdash;giant columns have been swept away like reeds before
the mighty avalanche, and one hardly misses them. And that
hall, who could describe it? Its dimensions, one hundred and
seventy feet by three hundred and twenty-nine,&mdash;-the height of
the central avenue of columns sixty-six feet, exclusive of their
pedestals,&mdash;the total number of columns that supported its
roof one hundred and thirty-four. These particulars may give
you some idea of its extent; but of its grandeur and beauty&mdash;none.
Every column is sculptured, and all have been richly
painted. The exterior walls, too, are a sculptured history of
the wars of Osirei and Rameses. Except those at Beit Wellee
I have seen nothing in Egypt that would interest so much.
In one corner, of especial interest, are represented the Jews
captured by Shishak, and their king Rehoboam, with the
hieroglyphical inscription &#8216;Jehouda Melek,&#8217; the king of the
Jews. This is the only reference to the Israelites found in
Egyptian sculpture. Many have wondered at finding no allusions
to their residence in Egypt; but I think without cause;
for, except the pyramids, the tombs in their vicinity, those of
Beni Hassan, and a few other remains, of but little interest, I
do not believe that any monuments exist, coeval with Moses
and the Exodus.&#8221;</p>

<p>The remains of this temple are thus described by
Denon:&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Of the hundred columns of the portico alone, the smallest
are seven feet and a half in diameter, and the largest twelve;
the space occupied by the circumvallation of the temple contains
lakes and mountains. In short, to be enabled to form a
competent idea of so much magnificence, the reader ought to
fancy what is before him to be a dream; as he who views the
objects themselves rubs his eyes to know whether he is awake.
The avenue leading from Karnac to Luxor, a space nearly half
a league in extent, contains a constant succession of sphinxes
and other chimerical figures to the right and left, together with
fragments of stone walls, of small columns, and of statues.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;The most ancient remains,&#8221; says Mr. Wilkinson,
&#8220;now existing at Thebes, are unquestionably in the
great temple of Karnac, the largest and most splendid
ruin<a name="FNanchor_273_282" id="FNanchor_273_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_282" class="fnanchor">273</a> of which, perhaps, either ancient or modern
times can boast; being the work of a number of successive
monarchs, each anxious to surpass his predecessor,
by increasing the dimensions and proportions
of the part he added.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is this fact which enables us to account for
the diminutive size of the older parts of this extensive
building; and their comparatively limited scale
offering greater facility, as their vicinity to the sanctuary
greater temptation, to an invading army to
destroy them, added to their remote antiquity, are
to be attributed their dilapidated state; as well as
the total disappearance of the sculptures executed
during the reigns of the Pharaohs, who preceded
Osirtesen I., the cotemporary of Joseph, and the
earliest monarch whose name exists on the monuments
of Thebes<a name="FNanchor_274_283" id="FNanchor_274_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_283" class="fnanchor">274</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Speaking of this magnificent edifice, and of the
vast sphinxes and other figures, Belzoni says:&mdash;&#8220;I
had seen the temple of Tentyra, and I still
acknowledge that nothing can exceed that edifice in
point of preservation, and the beauty of its workmanship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
and sculpture. But here I was lost in a
mass of colossal objects, every one of which was
more than sufficient of itself to attract my whole
attention. How can I describe my sensations at
that moment? I seemed alone in the midst of all
that is most sacred in the world; a forest of enormous
columns from top to bottom; the graceful shape
of the lotus, which forms their capitals, and is so
well proportioned to the columns; the gates, the
walls, the pedestals, the architraves, also adorned in
every part with symbolical figures in low-relief,
representing battles, processions, triumphs, feasts, and
sacrifices, all relating to the ancient history of the
country; the sanctuary wholly formed of fine red
granite; the high portals, seen at a distance from
the openings, of ruins of the other temples, within
sight;&mdash;these altogether had such an effect upon my
soul, as to separate me, in imagination, from the
rest of mortals, exalt me on high above all, and
cause me to forget entirely the trifles and follies of
life. I was happy for a whole day, which escaped
like a flash of lightning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here stood, and does now stand, a fragment of
the famous vocal statue of Memnon, which, many
writers attest, sent forth harmonious sounds, when
first touched of a morning by the rays of the sun.
The circumstance being attested by Strabo, Pliny,
Juvenal, Pausanias, Tacitus, and Philostratus, it is
assuredly not to be doubted. The first injury this
statue received was from Cambyses; who ordered it
to be sawed in two, in order to get at the secret. It
was afterwards thrown down by an earthquake.</p>

<p>Some have supposed, that the sounds alluded to
were produced by the mechanical impulse of the
sun&#8217;s light. Others that, being hollow, the air was
driven out by the rarefaction of the morning, which
occasioned the elicitation of a murmuring sound.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
But some assert, that it saluted the morning and
evening sun differently;&mdash;the former with animating
sounds; the latter with melancholy ones. Darwin,
in the true spirit of poetry, describes this statue as
sending forth murmurs of indignation at the ravages
of Cambyses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Prophetic whispers breathed from sphinx&#8217;s tongue;</span>
<span class="i0">And Memnon&#8217;s lyre with hollow murmurs rung.</span>
</div></div>

<p>In another passage, equally poetical, he makes it
view with delight the waters of the Nile, rushing
from the cataracts of Ethiopia:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Gigantic sphinx the circling waves admire;</span>
<span class="i0">And Memnon bending o&#8217;er his broken lyre.</span>
</div></div>

<p>In many parts of the East the custom still remains
of proclaiming the sun by the sounding of instruments.
That similar signals were given in Egypt is
not to be doubted, since the custom is almost as old
as solar adoration itself. That the sun was worshipped
in that country, is equally established: both
being rendered the more certain by the ceremony of
sounding harps, at sunrise, having been introduced
into Italy by Pythagoras, who had long sojourned
with the Egyptian magi. The sounding of Memnon&#8217;s
statue, then, might have been an artifice of the
priesthood; to effect which many methods might
have been adopted. Either the head of Memnon
contained wires, like the strings of an &AElig;olian harp;
or the sounds might have been produced by the
touching of a stone<a name="FNanchor_275_284" id="FNanchor_275_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_284" class="fnanchor">275</a>.</p>

<p>The real cause of the sound has lately been
discovered by Mr. Wilkinson:&mdash;&#8220;In the lap of the
statue is a stone, which, on being struck, elicits a
metallic sound, that might still be made use of to
deceive a visitor, who was predisposed to believe its
powers; and from its position, and the squared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>space cut in the block behind, as if to admit a person,
who might thus lie concealed from the most scrutinous
observer in the plain below, it seems to have
been used after the restoration of the statue; and
another similar recess exists beneath the present site
of the stone, which might have been intended for
the same purpose, when the statue was in its mutilated
state.&#8221;</p>

<p>This statue has frequently been mistaken for the
statue of Osymandyas. Strabo says, that it was
named Ismandes. These words were derived from
Os-Smandi, to give out a sound; a property possessed,
it was said, by this statue at the dawn of day
and at sunset. Its true name was Amenophis. It
was visited by Germanicus. On its legs are to be
seen Greek and Roman inscriptions, attesting the
prodigy of the harmonious sounds emitted by this
colossus.</p>

<p>After the temples at Karnac and Luxor, the next
grand building at Thebes was the Memnonium; that is,
the tomb or palace of one of the Pharaohs, whom the
Greeks suppose to be the same as Memnon. In the
middle of the first court was the largest figure ever
raised by the Egyptians,&mdash;the statue of the monarch,
seventy-five feet high.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;The name <span class="smcap">Memnonium</span><a name="FNanchor_276_285" id="FNanchor_276_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_285" class="fnanchor">276</a> is used by Strabo to designate
some part of ancient Thebes lying on the western side of
the river. Some modern travellers have applied it to a mass of
ruins at a little distance to the north of Medeenet-Habou,
which are by others identified with the palace and tomb of
Osymandyas, described by Diodorus. The dimensions of the
building are about five hundred and thirty feet in length, and
two hundred in width: it is chiefly remarkable for the magnificent
colossal statues which have been discovered within it.
The &#8216;Memnon&#8217;s head,&#8217; which forms so valuable an object in
the collection of Egyptian antiquities contained in the British
Museum, formerly belonged to one of these statues. It is
generally supposed that the French, during their celebrated
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>expedition, separated the bust from the rest of the figure by
the aid of gunpowder, with the view of rendering its transport
more easy. They were compelled, however, from some cause
or other, to leave it behind, and it was brought away by
Belzoni.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Close to the spot where the Memnon&#8217;s head was found,
lie the fragments of another statue, which has been called the
largest in Egypt. It was placed in a sitting posture, and
measures sixty-two or sixty-three feet round the shoulders;
six feet ten inches over the foot. The length of the nail of the
second toe is about one foot, and the length of the toe to the
insertion of the nail is one foot eleven inches. This enormous
statue, formed of red granite, has been broken off at the waist,
and the upper part is now laid prostrate on the back: the face
is entirely obliterated, and next to the wonder excited at the
boldness of the sculptor who made it, as Mr. Hamilton
remarks, and the extraordinary powers of those who erected
it, the labour and exertions that must have been used for its
destruction are most astonishing.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;The mutilation of this statue must have been a work of
extreme difficulty: Hamilton says that it could only have been
brought about with the help of military engines, and must then
have been the work of a length of time; in its fall it has
carried along with it the whole of the wall of the temple
which stood within its reach.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;We have remarked that this edifice, called the Memnonium,
is by many travellers identified with that described by
Diodorus, under the name of the monument of Osymandyas;
his description is the only detailed account which we have in
the ancient writers of any great Egyptian building. There is
no one now at Thebes to which it may be applied in all its
parts, or with which it so far agrees, as to leave no doubt concerning
the edifice to which it was intended to apply by its
author; and Mr. Hamilton expresses his decided opinion that
Diodorus, in penning this description of the tomb of Osymandyas,
either listened with too easy credulity to the fanciful
relations of the Greek travellers, to whom he refers; or that,
astonished with the immensity of the monuments he must have
read and heard of as contained within the walls of the capital
of Egypt, and equally unwilling to enter into a minute detail
of them all, as to omit all mention of them whatever, he set
himself down to compose an imaginary building, to which he
could give a popular name. In this he might collect, in some
kind of order, all the most remarkable features of Theban
monuments, statues, columns, obelisks, sculptures, &amp;c. to
form one entire whole that might astonish his reader without
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>tiring him by prolixity or repetition, and which at the same
time gave him a just notion of the magnificent and splendid
works which had immortalised the monarchs of the Thebaid.
It is evident that there is no one monument in Thebes which
answers in all its parts to the description of Diodorus; yet it
is urged that there is scarcely any one circumstance that he
mentions that may not be referred to one or other of the
temples of Luxor, Karnak, Goorno, Medeenet-Habou, or the
tombs of the kings among the mountains. Others think that
Diodorus used his best endeavours to describe a real place;
and the chief agreements with that now called the Memnonium
are in the position of the building and its colossal statues,
which are supposed to outweigh the exaggerations of dimension;
these being set down as faults of memory or observation.
On the colossal statue mentioned by Diodorus as the largest
in Egypt, was placed, as he tells us, this inscription:&mdash;&#8216;<i>I am
Osymandyas, king of kings: if you wish to know how great I
am, and where I lie, surpass my works!</i>&#8217; He speaks also of
certain sculptures representing battle scenes; and of the famous
sacred library, which was inscribed with the words, &#8216;<i>Place of
cure for the soul!</i>&#8217; Yet from this conclusion we learn that he
has been describing what the tomb of Osymandyas <i>was</i>, &#8216;which
not only in the expense of the structure, but also in the skill
of the workmanship, must have surpassed by far all other
buildings.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The following observations and history are taken
from an exceedingly learned and agreeable work,
&#8220;Egyptian Antiquities:&#8221;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Those who visit the British Museum cannot fail to have
observed, in the room of Egyptian antiquities, a colossal statue
of which only the head and breast remain. It is numbered
66 in the catalogue and on the stone. Though this statue is
commonly called the &#8216;Younger Memnon,&#8217; a name to which
for convenience we shall adhere, there is no reason in the
world for calling it so, but a mistake of Norden, a Danish traveller,
who visited Egypt in 1737. He then saw this statue
in its entire state, seated on a chair, in precisely the same
attitude as the black breccia figure, No. 38, but lying with its
face on the ground; to which accident, indeed, the preservation
of the features is no doubt mainly due. Several ancient
writers, and among them the Greek geographer Strabo, speak
of a large temple at Thebes on the west side of the Nile, to
which they gave the name of the Memnonium, or Memnon&#8217;s
temple. Norden fancied that the building, amidst whose ruins
he saw this statue, was the ancient Memnonium: though he
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>supposed, that another statue of much larger dimensions than
this in the Museum, and now lying in numerous fragments in
the same place, was the great Memnon statue, of which some
ancient writers relate the following fact:&mdash;That at sunrise,
when the rays first struck the statue, it sent forth a sound
something like that of the snapping of the string of a lute.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;It is now generally admitted, that the real statue of
Memnon is neither the large one still lying at Thebes in fragments,
nor this statue in the Museum, which came out of the
same temple&mdash;but another statue still seated in its original position
on the plain of Thebes, and showing by numerous Greek
and Latin inscriptions on the legs, that <i>it</i> was the statue of
which Strabo, Pausanias, and other ancient writers speak.
The entire black statue, No. 38, is also <i>a</i> Memnon statue, for
it resembles in all respects the great colossus with the inscriptions
on its legs, and it has also the name of Memnon written
on it, and enclosed in an oblong ring, on each side of the front
part of the seat, and also on the back. If this colossus in the
Museum (No. 66) was entire in 1737, it may be asked how
came it to be broken? We cannot say further than the following
statement:&mdash;Belzoni went to Egypt in 1815, intending
to propose to the Pasha some improved mechanical contrivances
for raising water from the river in order to irrigate
the fields. Owing to various obstacles, this scheme did not
succeed, and Belzoni determined to pay a visit to Upper Egypt
to see the wonderful remains of its temples. Mr. Salt, then
British Consul in Egypt, and Lewis Burckhardt, commissioned
Belzoni to bring this colossal head from Thebes.  Belzoni
went up the river, and, landing at Thebes, found the statue
exactly in the place where the Consul&#8217;s instructions described
it to be.<a name="FNanchor_277_286" id="FNanchor_277_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_286" class="fnanchor">277</a> It was lying &#8216;near the remains of its body and
chair, with its face upwards, and apparently smiling on me at
the thought of being taken to England. I must say, that my
expectations were exceeded by its beauty, but not by its size.
I observed that it must have been absolutely the same statue
as is mentioned by Norden, lying in his time with the face
downwards, which must have been the cause of its preservation.
I will not venture to assert who separated the bust from
the rest of the body by an explosion, or by whom the bust has
been turned face upwards.&#8217; It will be observed that the left
shoulder of this figure is shattered, and that there is a large
hole drilled in the right shoulder. We believe both are the
work of the French who visited Thebes during the occupation
of Egypt by the French army in 1800; and there is no doubt
that Belzoni, in the above extract, means to attribute to them
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>the separation of the head and shoulders from the rest of the
body. In the magnificent work on Egyptian Antiquities, which
has been published at Paris, there is a drawing of this head,
which is pretty correct, except that the hole and the whole
<i>right</i> shoulder are wanting. It seems that they drew the
colossal bust in that form which it would have assumed, had
they blown off the right shoulder. From what cause it happened
we do not know, but they left the colossus behind
them; and Belzoni, alone and unaided, accomplished what the
French had unsuccessfully attempted.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;All the implements that Belzoni had for removing this colossus
were fourteen poles, eight of which were employed in
making a car for the colossus, four ropes of palm-leaves, four
rollers, and no tackle of any description. With these sorry
implements and such wretched workmen as the place could produce,
he contrived to move the colossus from the ruins where
it lay to the banks of the Nile, a distance considerably more
than a mile. But it was a no less difficult task to place the colossus
on board a boat, the bank of the river being &#8216;more than
fifteen feet above the level of the water, which had retired at
least a hundred yards from it.&#8217; This, however, was effected by
making a sloping causeway, along which the heavy mass descended
slowly till it came to the lower part, where, by means
of four poles, a kind of bridge was made, having one end resting
on the centre parts of the boat, and the other on the inclined
plane. Thus the colossus was moved into the boat without any
danger of tilting it over by pressing too much on one side.
From Thebes it was carried down the river to Rosetta, and
thence to Alexandria, a distance of more than four hundred
miles: from the latter place it was embarked for England.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;The material of this colossus is a fine-grained granite, which
is found in the quarries near the southern boundary of Egypt,
from which masses of enormous size may be procured free from
any split or fracture. These quarries supplied the Egyptians
with the principal materials for their colossal statues and obelisks,
some of which, in an unfinished form, may still be seen in
the granite quarries of Assouan. There is considerable variety
in the qualities of this granite, as we may see from the specimens
in the Museum, some of which consist of much larger component
parts than others, and in different proportions; yet all of
them admit a fine polish. The colossal head, No. 8, opposite
to the Memnon, No. 2, commonly called an altar, will serve to
explain our meaning.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;This Memnon&#8217;s bust consists of one piece of stone, of two
different colours, of which the sculptor has judiciously applied
the red part to form the face. Though there is a style of sculpture
which we may properly call Egyptian, as distinguished
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>from and inferior to the Greek, and though this statue clearly
belongs to the Egyptian style, it surpasses as a work of art
most other statues from that country by a peculiar sweetness of
expression and a finer outline of face. Though the eyebrows
are hardly prominent enough for our taste, the nose somewhat
too rounded, and the lips rather thick, it is impossible to deny
that there is great beauty stamped on the countenance. Its
profile, when viewed from various points, will probably show
some new beauties to those only accustomed to look at it in
front. The position of the ear in all Egyptian statues that we
have had an opportunity of observing is very peculiar, being
always too high; and the ear itself is rather large. We might
almost infer, that there was some national peculiarity in this
member, from seeing it so invariably placed in the same singular
position. The appendage to the chin is common in Egyptian
colossal statues, and is undoubtedly intended to mark the beard,
the symbol of manhood; and it may be observed not only on
numerous statues, but also on painted reliefs, where we frequently
see it projecting from the end of the chin and not attached
to the breast, but slightly curved upwards. Osiris, one
of the great objects of Egyptian adoration, is often thus represented;
but the beard is generally only attached to the
<i>clothed</i> figure, being, for the most part, but not always,
omitted on naked ones. The colossal figures, No. 8 and
38, have both lost their beards. There is a colossal head in the
Museum, No. 57, that is peculiar in having the upper margin
of the beard represented by incisions on the chin, after the fashion
of Greek bearded statues. It is the only instance we have
seen, either in reality or in any drawing, of a colossus with a
genuine beard. There is more variety in the head-dresses of
colossal statues than in their beards. No. 8, opposite the
Memnon, has the high cap which occurs very often on Egyptian
<i>standing</i> colossi, which are placed with their backs to pilasters.
No. 38 has the flat cap fitting close to the head and descending
behind, very much like the pigtails once in fashion. The Memnon
head-dress differs from both of these, and has given rise to
discussions, called learned, into which we cannot enter here.
On the forehead of this colossus may be seen the remains of
the erect serpent, the emblem of royalty, which always indicates
a deity or a royal personage. This erect serpent may be traced
on various monuments of the Museum, and perhaps occurs
more frequently than any single sculptured object.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Our limits prevent us from going into other details, but
we have perhaps said enough to induce some of our readers to
look more carefully at this curious specimen of Egyptian art;
and to examine the rest of the ornamental parts. The following
are some of the principal dimensions:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span></p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Judging from these dimensions, the figure in its entire
state would be about twenty-four feet high as seated on its
chair: which is about half the height of the <i>real</i> Memnon, who
still sits majestic on his ancient throne, and throws his long
shadow at sun-rise over the plain of Thebes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many pages have been written in regard to the
time when the arch was first invented. It is not
known that the two divisions of the city were ever
connected by any bridge.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;A people,&#8221; remarks Heeren, &#8220;whose knowledge of architecture
had not attained to the formation of arches, could
hardly have constructed a bridge over a river, the breadth of
which would even now oppose great obstacles to such an
undertaking. We have reason to believe, however, that the
Egyptians were acquainted with the formation of the arch,
and did employ it on many occasions. Belzoni contends that
such was the case, and asserts that there is now at Thebes a
genuine specimen, which establishes the truth of his assertion.
No question exists, it should be observed, that arches are to be
found in Thebes; it is their antiquity alone which has been
doubted. The testimony of Mr. Wilkinson on this point is
decisive in their favour. He tells us that he had long been persuaded
that most of the innumerable vaults and arches to be
seen at Thebes, were of an early date, although unfortunately,
from their not having the names of any of the kings inscribed
on them, he was unable to prove the fact; when, at last,
chance threw in his way a tomb vaulted in the usual manner,
and with an arched door-way, &#8216;the whole stuccoed, and bearing
on every part of it the fresco paintings and name of Amunoph
the First,&#8217; who ascended the throne 1550 years <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span>
We thus learn that the arch was in use in Egypt nearly three
thousand four hundred years ago,&mdash;or more than twelve hundred
years before the period usually assigned as the date of its
introduction among the Greeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>At Thebes have lately been found, that is, about
fifteen years ago, several papyri; one of which gives
an ancient contract for the sale of land in this city.
The following is a translation:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span></p>

<p class="small">&#8220;&#8216;<i>In the reign of Cleopatra and Ptolemy her son, surnamed

complexion, cheerful countenance, long face, and straight nose,
with a scar upon the middle of his forehead; for 601 pieces of
brass; the sellers standing as brokers, and as securities for

the transfer of landed property, and the produce of it was
farmed out in this case to certain &#8216;partners.&#8217;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;According to Champollion, the date of this contract corresponds
to the 13th or 14th of February, 105 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span>, and that
of the registry to the 6th or the 14th of May in the same year.
Dr. Young fixes it in the year 106 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span></p>

<p class="small">&#8220;The contract is written in Greek; it is usually called the
&#8216;Contract of Ptolemais,&#8217; or the &#8216;Papyrus of M. d&#8217;Anatasy,&#8217;
having been first procured by a gentleman of that name, the
Swedish consul at Alexandria. Three other deeds of a similar
kind, but rather older, and written in the <i>enchorial</i>, or <i>demotic</i>
character, were brought from Thebes, about fifteen years ago,
by a countryman of our own, Mr. G. F. Grey, the same gentleman
who was fortunate enough to bring that Greek papyrus
which turned out, by a most marvellous coincidence, to be a
copy of an Egyptian manuscript which Dr. Young was at the
very time trying to decipher. These three deeds are in the
enchorial character, and accompanied with a registry in Greek.
They all relate to the transfer of land &#8216;at the southern end of
Diospolis the Great,&#8217; as the Greek registries have it. The
Greek papyrus, too, of which we just spoke, and the original
Paris manuscript, of which it is a copy, are instruments for the
transfer of the rent of certain tombs in the Libyan suburb of
Thebes, in the Memnonia; and also of the proceeds arising
from the performance of certain &#8216;liturgies&#8217; on the account of
the deceased. They have been invaluable aids in the study of
ancient Egyptian literature.&#8221;</p>

<p>The emperor Constantine, ambitious of foreign
ornaments, resolved to decorate his newly-founded
capital of Constantinople with the largest of all the
obelisks that stood on the ruins of Thebes. He succeeded
in having it conveyed as far as Alexandria,
but, dying at the time, its destination was changed;
and an enormous raft, managed by three hundred
rowers, transported the granite obelisk from Alexandria
to Rome.</p>

<p>Among the treasures of antiquity, found in the
Thebais, were, till very lately, two granite columns,
of precisely the same character as Cleopatra&#8217;s Needles.
Of these one remains on the spot; the other, with
great labour and expense, has been transported to
Paris. When the French army, in their attempt on
Egypt, penetrated as far as Thebes, they were, almost
to a man, overpowered by the majesty of the
ancient monuments they saw before them; and
Buonaparte is then said to have conceived the idea of
removing at least one of the obelisks to Paris. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
reverses and defeat followed. The French were compelled
to abandon Egypt; and the English, remaining
masters of the seas, effectually prevented any such
importation into France.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;<a name="FNanchor_279_288" id="FNanchor_279_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_288" class="fnanchor">279</a>Thirty years after Buonaparte&#8217;s first conception of the idea,
the French government, then under Charles X., having obtained
the consent of the pasha of Egypt, determined that one
of the obelisks of Luxor should be brought to Paris. &#8216;The
difficulties of doing this,&#8217; says M. Delaborde, &#8216;were great. In
the first place, it was necessary to build a vessel which should
be large enough to contain the monument, deep enough to
stand the sea, and, at the same time, draw so little water as to
be able to ascend and descend such rivers as the Nile and the
Seine.&#8217;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;In the month of February, 1831, when the crown of France
had passed into the hands of Louis Philippe, a vessel, built as
nearly as could be on the necessary principles, was finished
and equipped at Toulon. This vessel, which for the sake of
lightness was chiefly made of fir and other white wood, was
named the &#8216;Luxor.&#8217; The crew consisted of one hundred and
twenty seamen, under the command of Lieutenant Verninac,
of the French royal navy; and there went, besides, sixteen
mechanics of different professions, and a master to direct the
works under the superintendence of M. Lebas.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;After staying forty-two days at Alexandria, the expedition
sailed for the mouth of the Nile. At Rosetta they remained
some days, and on the 20th of June M. Lebas, the engineer,
two officers, and a few of the sailors and workmen, leaving the
&#8216;Luxor&#8217; to make her way up the river slowly, embarked in
common Nile-boats for Thebes, carrying with them the tools
and materials necessary for the removal of the obelisk. The
&#8216;Luxor&#8217; did not arrive at Thebes until the 14th of August,
which was two months after her departure from Alexandria.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Reaumur&#8217;s thermometer marked from thirty degrees to
thirty-eight in the shade, and ascended to fifty, and even to
fifty-five degrees, in the sun. Several of the sailors were seized
with dysentery, and the quantity of sand blown about by the
wind, and the glaring reflection of the burning sun, afflicted
others with painful ophthalmia. The sand was particularly
distressing: one day the wind raised it and rolled it onward in
such volume as, at intervals, to obscure the light of the sun.
After they had felicitated themselves on the fact that the plague
was not in the country, they were struck with alarm, on the
29th of August, by learning that the cholera morbus had
broken out most violently at Cairo. On the 11th of September
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
the same mysterious disease declared itself on the plain of
Thebes, with the natives of which the French were obliged to
have frequent communications. In a very short time fifteen
of the sailors, according to M. J. U. Angelina, the surgeon,
caught the contagion, but every one recovered under his care
and skill.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;In the midst of these calamities and dangers, the French
sailors persevered in preparing the operations relative to the
object of the expedition. One of the first cares of M. Lebas,
on his arriving on the plain of Thebes, was to erect near to
the obelisks, and not far from the village of Luxor, proper
wooden barracks&mdash;sheds and tents to lodge the officers, sailors,
and workmen on shore; he also built an oven to bake them
bread, and magazines in which to secure their provisions, and
the sails, cables, &amp;c. of the vessel.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;The now desolate site, on which the City of the Hundred
Gates once stood, offered them no resources of civilised life.
But French soldiers and sailors are happily, and, we may say,
honourably distinguished, by the facility with which they
adapt themselves to circumstances, and turn their hands to
whatever can add to their comfort and well-being. The sailors
on this expedition, during their hours of repose from more
severe labours, carefully prepared and dug up pieces of ground
for kitchen-gardens. They cultivated bread-melons and watermelons,
lettuces, and other vegetables; they even planted some
trees, which thrived very well; and, in short, they made their
place of temporary residence a little paradise, as compared with
the wretched huts and neglected fields of the oppressed natives.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;It was the smaller of the two obelisks the French had to
remove; but this smaller column of hard, heavy granite was
seventy-two French feet high, and was calculated to weigh
upwards of two hundred and forty tons. It stood, moreover,
at the distance of about one thousand two hundred feet from
the Nile, and the intervening space presented many difficulties.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;M. Lebas commenced by making an inclined plane, extending
from the base of the obelisk to the edge of the river.
This work occupied nearly all the French sailors, and about
seven hundred Arabs, during three months; for they were
obliged to cut through two hills of ancient remains and rubbish,
to demolish half of the poor villages which lay in their
way<a name="FNanchor_280_289" id="FNanchor_280_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_289" class="fnanchor">280</a>, and to beat, equalise, and render firm the uneven, loose,
and crumbling soil. This done, the engineer proceeded to
make the ship ready for the reception of the obelisk. The
vessel had been left aground by the periodical fall of the
waters of the Nile, and matters had been so managed that she
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>lay imbedded in the sand, with her figure-head pointing
directly towards the temple and the granite column. The
engineer, taking care not to touch the keel, sawed off a section
of the front of the ship; in short, he cut away her bows, which
were raised, and kept suspended above the place they properly
occupied, by means of pulleys and some strong spars, which
crossed each other above the vessel.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;The ship, thus opened, presented in front a large mouth to
receive its cargo, which was to reach the very lip of that mouth
or opening, by sliding down the inclined plane. The preparations
for bringing the obelisk safely down to the ground lasted
from the 11th of July to the 31st of October, when it was laid
horizontally on its side.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;The rose-coloured granite of Syene (the material of these
remarkable works of ancient art), though exceedingly hard, is
rather brittle. By coming into contact with other substances,
and by being impelled along the inclined plane, the beautiful
hieroglyphics, sculptured on its surface, might have been defaced,
and the obelisk might have suffered other injuries. To
prevent these, M. Lebas encased it, from its summit to its
base, in strong thick wooden sheathings, well secured to the
column by means of hoops. The western face of this covering,
which was that upon which the obelisk was to slide down the
inclined plane, was rendered smooth, and was well rubbed
with grease to make it run the easier.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;To move so lofty and narrow an object from its centre of
gravity was no difficult task,&mdash;but then came the moment of
intense anxiety! The whole of the enormous weight bore upon
the cable, the cordage, and machinery, which quivered and
cracked in all their parts. Their tenacity, however, was equal
to the strain, and so ingeniously were the mechanical powers
applied, that eight men in the rear of the descending column
were sufficient to accelerate or retard its descent.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;On the following day the much less difficult task of getting
the obelisk on board the ship was performed. It only occupied
an hour and a half to drag the column down the inclined plane,
and (through the open mouth in front) into the hold of the
vessel. The section of the suspended bows was then lowered
to the proper place, and readjusted and secured as firmly as
ever by the carpenters and other workmen. So nicely was this
important part of the ship sliced off, and then put to again,
that the mutilation was scarcely perceptible.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;The obelisk was embarked on the 1st of November, 1831,
but it was not until the 18th August 1832, that the annual rise
of the Nile afforded sufficient water to float their long-stranded
ship. At last, however, to their infinite joy, they were ordered
to prepare every thing for the voyage homewards. As soon as
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>this was done, sixty Arabs were engaged to assist in getting
them down the river, (a distance of 180 leagues), and the &#8216;Luxor&#8217;
set sail.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;After thirty-six days of painful navigation, but without
meeting with any serious accident, they reached Rosetta; and
there they were obliged to stop, because the sand bank off that
mouth of the Nile had accumulated to such a degree, that,
with its present cargo the vessel could not clear it. Fortunately,
however, on the 30th of December, a violent hurricane dissipated
part of this sand-bank; and, on the first of January,
1833, at ten o&#8217;clock in the morning, the &#8216;Luxor&#8217; shot safely out
of the Nile, and at nine o&#8217;clock on the following morning came
to a secure anchorage in the old harbour of Alexandria.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Here they awaited the return of the fine season for navigating
the Mediterranean; and the Sphynx (a French man-of-war)
taking the &#8216;Luxor&#8217; in tow, they sailed from Alexandria
on the 1st of April. On the 2nd, a storm commenced,
which kept the &#8216;Luxor&#8217; in imminent danger for two whole days.
On the 6th, the storm abated; but the wind continued contrary,
and soon announced a fresh tempest. They had just
time to run for shelter into the bay of Marmara, when the
storm became more furious than ever.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;On the 13th of April, they again weighed anchor, and
shaped their course for Malta; but a violent contrary wind
drove them back as far as the Greek island of Milo, where
they were detained two days. Sailing, however, on the 17th,
they reached Navarino on the 18th, and the port of Corfu,
where they were kindly received by Lord Nugent and the
British, on the 23d of April. Between Corfu and Cape Spartivento,
heavy seas and high winds caused the &#8216;Luxor&#8217; to
labour and strain exceedingly. As soon, however, as they
reached the coast of Italy, the sea became calm, and a light
breeze carried them forward, at the rate of four knots an hour,
to Toulon, where they anchored during the evening on the 11th
of May.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;They had now reached the port whence they had departed,
but their voyage was not yet finished. There is no carriage by
water, or by any other commodious means, for so heavy and
cumbrous a mass as an Egyptian obelisk, from Toulon to
Paris (a distance of above four hundred and fifty miles). To
meet this difficulty they must descend the rest of the Mediterranean,
pass nearly the whole of the southern coast of France,
and all the south of Spain&mdash;sail through the straits of Gibraltar,
and traverse part of the Atlantic, as far as the mouth of the
Seine, which river affords a communication between the
French capital and the ocean.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;Accordingly, on the 22d of June, they sailed from Toulon,
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>the &#8216;Luxor&#8217; being again taken in tow by the Sphynx man-of-war;
and, after experiencing some stormy weather, finally
reached Cherbourg on the 5th of August, 1833. The whole
distance performed in this voyage was upwards of four hundred
leagues.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;As the royal family of France was expected at Cherbourg by
the 31st of August, the authorities detained the &#8216;Luxor&#8217; there.
On the 2d of September, King Louis Philippe paid a visit to
the vessel, and warmly expressed his satisfaction to the officers
and crew. He was the first to inform M. Verninac, the commander,
that he was promoted to the rank of captain of a
sloop-of-war. On the following day, the king distributed decorations
of the Legion of Honour to the officers, and entertained
them at dinner.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;The &#8216;Luxor,&#8217; again towed by the Sphynx, left Cherbourg on
the 12th of September, and safely reached Havre de Grace, at
the mouth of the Seine. Here her old companion, the Sphynx,
which drew too much water to be able to ascend the river, left
her, and she was taken in tow by the Neva steam-boat. To
conclude with the words of our author: &#8216;At six o&#8217;clock (on
the 13th) our vessel left the sea for ever, and entered the
Seine. By noon we had cleared all the banks and impediments
of the lower part of the river; and on the 14th of September
at noon, we arrived at Rouen, where the &#8216;Luxor&#8217; was
made fast before the quay d&#8217;Harcourt. Here we must remain
until the autumnal rains raise the waters of the Seine, and
permit us to transport to Paris this pyramid,&mdash;the object of
our expedition.&#8217; This event has since happened, and the
recent French papers announce that the obelisk has been set
up in the centre of the Place Louis XVI.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a more detailed account of this wonderful
city, we must refer to the learned and elaborate account,
published a few years since, by Mr. Wilkinson.
We now have space only for impressions.</p>

<p>&#8220;That ancient city, celebrated by the first of poets
and historians that are now extant: &#8216;that venerable
city,&#8217; as Pococke so plaintively expresses it, &#8216;the
date of whose ruin is older than the foundation of
most other cities,&#8217; offers, at this day, a picture of
desolation and fallen splendour, more complete than
can be found elsewhere; and yet &#8216;such vast and surprising
remains,&#8217; to continue in the words of the same
old traveller, &#8216;are still to be seen, of such magnificence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
and solidity, as may convince any one that beholds
them, that without some extraordinary accident,
they must have lasted for ever, which seems to
have been the intention of the founders of them.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Their very aspect,&#8221; says Savary, &#8220;would awaken
the genius of a polished nation; but the Turks and
Copts, crushed to dust beneath an iron sceptre, behold
them without astonishment, and build huts,
which even scarcely screen them from the sun, in
their neighbourhood. These barbarians, if they want
a mill-stone, do not blush to overturn a column,
the support of a temple or portico, and saw it in
pieces! Thus abject does despotism render men.&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;All
here is sublime, all majestic. The kings
seem to have acquired the glory of never dying while
the obelisks and colossal statues exist; and have only
laboured for immortality. They could preserve their
memory against the efforts of time, but not against the
efforts of the barbarism of conquerors; those dreadful
scourges of science and nations, which, in their pride,
they have too often erased from the face of the earth.&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;With
pain one tears oneself from Thebes. Her
monuments fix the traveller&#8217;s eyes, and fill his mind
with vast ideas. Beholding colossal figures, and
stately obelisks, which seem to surpass human
powers, he says,&mdash;&#8216;Man has done this,&#8217; and feels
himself and his species ennobled. True it is, when
he looks down on the wretched huts, standing beside
these magnificent labours, and when he perceives an
ignorant people, instead of a scientific nation, he
grieves for the generations that are past, and the
arts that have perished with them; yet this very
grief has a kind of charm for a heart of sensibility.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be difficult,&#8221; says Sonnini, &#8220;to describe
the sensations which the sight of objects so
grand, so majestic, raised within me. It was not a
simple adoration merely, but an ecstacy which suspended
the use of all my faculties. I remained some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
time immoveable with rapture, and I felt inclined
more than once to prostrate myself in token of veneration
before monuments, the rearing of which appeared
to transcend the strength and genius of man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let the so much boasted fabrics of Greece and Rome
(continues he) come and bow down before the temples
and palaces of Thebes and Egypt. Its lofty
ruins are still more striking than their gaudy ornaments;
its gigantic wrecks are more majestic than
their perfect preservation. The glory of the most
celebrated fabrics vanishes before the prodigies of
Egyptian architecture; and to describe them justly,
a man must possess the genius of those who conceived
and executed them, or the eloquent pen of a
Bossuet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On turning,&#8221; says Denon, &#8220;the point of a chain
of mountains, we saw, all at once, ancient Thebes in
its full extent&mdash;that Thebes whose magnitude has
been pictured to us by a single word in Homer,
<i>hundred-gated</i>&mdash;renowned for numerous kings, who,
through their wisdom, have been elevated to the
rank of gods; for laws which have been revered
without being known; for sciences which have been
confided to proud and mysterious inscriptions; wise
and earliest monuments of the arts which time has
respected; this sanctuary, abandoned, isolated through
barbarism, and surrendered to the desert from which
it was won; this city, shrouded in the veil of mystery,
by which even colossi are magnified; this remote
city, which imagination has only caught a glimpse
of through the darkness of time, was still so gigantic
an apparition, that, at the sight of its ruins, the French
army halted of its own accord, and the soldiers, with
one spontaneous movement, clapped their hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Richardson, who visited Thebes many years
after Denon, tells us, that as he approached it in the
night, he could not judge of the awful grandeur of
that first appearance, which so powerfully affected the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
enthusiastic Frenchman. &#8220;But the next morning&#8217;s
sun convinced us,&#8221; he says, &#8220;that the ruins can
scarcely be seen from the river; that no where does
the traveller turn the corner of the mountain to come
in sight of them; and that he must be near them, or
among them, before he can discover any thing.&#8221; Yet
both Denon&#8217;s drawings, and the more recent ones of
Captain W. F. Head, give some distant views of the
ruins, which are very effective.</p>

<p>Mons. Champollion speaks of Thebes in terms of
equal admiration:&mdash;&#8220;All that I had seen, all that I
had learned on the left bank, appeared miserable in
comparison with the gigantic conceptions by which
I was surrounded at Karnac. I shall take care not
to attempt to describe any thing; for either my description
would not express the thousandth part of
what ought to be said, or if I drew a faint sketch, I
should be taken for an enthusiast, or, perhaps, for a
madman. It will suffice to add, that no people,
either ancient or modern, ever conceived the art of
architecture on so sublime, and so grand, a scale, as
the ancient Egyptians. Their conceptions were those
of men a hundred feet high.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Carne speaks to the same effect:&mdash;&#8220;It is difficult
to describe the noble and stupendous ruins of
Thebes. Beyond all others, they give you the idea
of a ruined, yet imperishable, city: so vast is their
extent, that you wander a long time, confused and
perplexed, and discover at every step some new object
of interest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The temple of Luxor,&#8221; says Belzoni, &#8220;presents
to the traveller, at once, one of the most splendid
groups of Egyptian grandeur. The extensive propylæon,
with two obelisks, and colossal statues in
front, the thick groups of enormous columns, the
variety of apartments, and the sanctuary it contains,
the beautiful ornaments which adorn every part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
the walls and columns, described by Mr. Hamilton,
cause, in the astonished traveller, an oblivion of all
that he has seen before. If his attention be attracted
to the north side of Thebes, by the towering remains
that project a great height above the wood of palm-trees,
he will gradually enter that forest-like assemblage
of ruins, of temples, columns, obelisks, colossi,
sphinxes, portals, and an endless number of other
astonishing objects, that will convince him at once of
the impossibility of a description. On the west side
of the Nile, still the traveller finds himself among
wonders. The temples of Gournou, Memnonium,
and Memdet Aboo, attest the extent of the great city
on this side. The unrivalled colossal figures in the
plains of Thebes, the number of tombs excavated in
the rocks; those in the great valley of their kings,
with their paintings, sculptures, mummies, sarcophagi,
figures, &amp;c., are all objects worthy of the
admiration of the traveller; who will not fail to
wonder how a nation, which was once so great as to
erect these stupendous edifices, could so far fall into
oblivion, that even their language and writing are
totally unknown to us. Very imperfect ideas,&#8221;
continues this celebrated traveller, &#8220;can be formed
of these extensive ruins, even from the accounts of
the most skilful and accurate travellers. It is absolutely
impossible to imagine the scene, displayed,
without seeing it. The most sublime ideas, that can
be formed from the most magnificent specimens of
our present architecture, would give a very incorrect
picture of these ruins; for such is the difference, not
only in magnitude, but in form, proportion, and construction,
that even the pencil can convey but a faint
idea of the whole. It appeared to me like entering
a city of giants, who, after a long conflict, were all
destroyed; leaving the ruins of their various temples
as the only proofs of their former existence.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span></p>

<p>Travellers have sometimes taken a fancy to visit
these ruins by moonlight; and the view which they
then present, though of course wanting in distinctness,
is described as extremely impressive. Mr.
Carne paid his second visit in this manner, and he
says that it was still more interesting than the other.
&#8220;The moon had risen, and we passed through one or
two Arab villages in the way, where fires were
lighted in the open air; and the men, after the labours
of the day, were seated in groups round them, smoking
and conversing with great cheerfulness. It is singular,
that in the most burning climates of the East,
the inhabitants love a good fire at night, and a traveller
soon catches the habit; yet the air was still
very warm. There was no fear of interruption in
exploring the ruins, for the Arabs dread to come
here after daylight, as they often say these places
were built by <i>Afrit</i>, the devil; and the belief in
apparitions prevails among most of the Orientals.
We again entered with delight the grand portico. It
was a night of uncommon beauty, without a breath
of wind stirring, and the moonlight fell vividly on
some parts of the colonnades, while others were
shaded so as to add to, rather than diminish, their
grandeur. The obelisks, the statues, the lonely
columns on the plain without, threw their long
shadows on the mass of ruins around them, and
the scene was in truth exquisitely mournful and
beautiful<a name="FNanchor_281_290" id="FNanchor_281_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_290" class="fnanchor">281</a>.&#8221;</p>

<h2>NO. XXXIX.&mdash;TROJA, AND OTHER CITIES OF THE
TROAS.</h2>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">It</span> has been asserted,&#8221; says Sir William Gell, &#8220;and
confidently maintained, that there does not exist the
smallest vestige of the ancient city of Priam; and it
is not the only capital concerning which the same
erroneous idea has prevailed. The &#8216;etiam periere
ruinæ&#8217; of Virgil<a name="FNanchor_282_291" id="FNanchor_282_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_291" class="fnanchor">282</a> seems to have been the foundation
of this opinion; and it is not wonderful, that it should
maintain its ground until the truth was investigated,
when we recollect that the ignorance of travellers for
a long time countenanced the idea, that not the
smallest trace of the great and powerful Babylon
remained, though destroyed at a period when the
credibility of history is universally admitted. The
existence, however, of the ruins of Babylon is now
perfectly established. If the situation of the most
magnificent capital of the four great monarchies of
the world could have so long escaped the researches
of modern inquirers, it will be granted that the vestiges
of a city, comparatively inconsiderable, the
capital but of a small territory, and destroyed in a
very remote age, might be easily overlooked.&#8221;</p>

<p>Diodorus Siculus relates, that the Samothracians
were accustomed to say, that the Pontic sea had once
been a vast pool of standing water, which, swollen
by rivers running into it, first overflowed to the
Cyanæ, two rocks of the Thracian Bosphorus; and
afterwards, forcing a way and flooding the champaign
country, formed the sea, called the Hellespont.</p>

<p>The Samothracians, also, related that Dardanus
passed over from their island, the place of his birth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>in a boat to the continent of Asia, and settled in the
Troia. Here this enterprising person, forming a
community, built a city, from him called Dardania,
situated on a small eminence near Mount Ida, and
the promontory of Sigæum, at the distance of about
four miles from the sea-shore.</p>

<p>This Dardanus is said to have espoused Asia,
called also Arisba and Batia, daughter of Teucer,
king of Teucria. He was succeeded by Ericthonius,
his son, who is celebrated in the Iliad for having
possessed three thousand horses; and for his being,
moreover, the richest of men. We ought to have
first stated, however, that Dardanus was accompanied
by his nephew Corybas, who introduced the
worship of Cybele; that he himself taught his subjects
to worship Minerva; and that he gave them
two statues of that goddess, one of which is well
known by the name of Palladium.</p>

<p>Ericthonius died 1374 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span> after a reign of seventy-five
years. He had one son, named Tros; and Tros
had three sons, of whom Ilus was his successor. His
barrow is mentioned in the Iliad, as still remaining
in the plain before the city. He married Eurydice,
the daughter of Adrastus, by whom he had Laomedon,
the father of Priam. He greatly embellished
the city of Dardanus, which from him was
called Ilium; as from his father it had been called
Troja.</p>

<p>Ilus was succeeded by his son, Laomedon. This
prince surrounded the city with walls; in which he
is fabulously stated to have been assisted by two
deities. For an account of this, the reader, if he
please, may consult Homer, Virgil, Ovid, and other
ancient poets. Not long after he had built the
walls, they are said to have been thrown down by
Hercules, the streets made desolate, and Laomedon
slain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span></p>

<p>Priamus, one of the most unfortunate as well as
one of the most celebrated of princes, succeeded his
father. The city, in his time, had recovered the
damage it had sustained, and became famous for its
wealth; more especially in brass and gold. Homer,
too, celebrates it for its walls and buildings. It was
situate on a rising ground amid morasses, which
were formed by the waters which, at certain seasons
of the year, descended in torrents from Mount Ida.
The language, as well as the religion, of this city was
the same as those appertaining to Greece; and the
dominions of the king comprised the whole of the
country lying within the isle of Lesbos, Phrygia, and
the Hellespont.</p>

<p>The reign of Priam is celebrated for the war, which
took place between the Trojans and Greeks. This
was made a subject of the finest poem that ever
honoured civilised society; but as the history of the
transaction differs, when treated by the poets, we,
as plain matter-of-fact persons, adopt that which has
been given us by Herodotus. We must, however,
first of all remark, that some, and most especially
Monsieur Pascal, have treated the whole as a mere
fable. &#8220;Homer,&#8221; say they, &#8220;wrote a romance: no
one can believe that Troy and Agamemnon had any
existence, any more than the golden apple. He had
no intention to write a history. He merely intended
to amuse and delight us.&#8221; And here we may advantageously
give place to several particular observations
of that accomplished traveller, Sir William Gell:&mdash;&#8220;In
approaching the Troas,&#8221; says he, &#8220;each bay,
mountain, and promontory, presented something new
to the eye, and excited the most agreeable reflections
in the mind; so that, in a few days, I found myself
in possession of a number of observations and drawings,
taken in a part of the world concerning which,
although much has been written, there still exists a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
great deficiency of those materials, which might
enable a reader to form a satisfactory opinion, without
encountering the difficulties of a tedious voyage.
I thought that such information would gratify men
of literature and inquiry. I was confident that delineations
and descriptions of a fertile plain, watered
by abundant and perennial streams, affording almost
impregnable positions, and so situated as to command
one of the most important passes of the world, must
be interesting, not to say valuable, to politicians and
statesmen. It is, perhaps, unnecessary to add, that I
was not without the hope of convincing others, as I
had been myself convinced, that the history, as related
by Homer, is confirmed by the fullest testimony,
which a perfect correspondence between the
present face of the country and the description of the
poet can possibly give to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>That the Trojan war absolutely took place is, however,
not so much to be believed on poetical authority,
as it is upon that of history. Not only Herodotus
and Thucydides have left records of it, but all
the biographers of Alexander. The testimony of
Thucydides is remarkable:&mdash;&#8220;The power of the
Greeks gradually advancing, they were enabled, in
process of time, to undertake the Trojan expedition.
It is further my opinion, that the assemblage of that
armament, by Agamemnon, was not owing so much
to the attendance of the suitors of Helen, in pursuance
of the oath they had sworn to Tyndarus, as
to his own superior power.&#8221; &#8220;To these enlargements
of power Agamemnon succeeding, and being also
superior to the rest of his countrymen in naval
strength, he was enabled, in my opinion, to form
that expedition more from awe than favour. It is
plain that he equipped out the largest number of
ships himself, besides those he lent to the Arcadians.
We ought not, therefore, to be incredulous, nor so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
much to regard the appearance of cities as their
power, and of course to conclude the armament
against Troy to have been greater than ever was
known before, but inferior to those of our age; and
whatever credit be given to the poetry of Homer in
this respect, who no doubt as a poet hath set it off
with all possible enlargement, yet even, according
to his account, it appears inferior.&#8221; &#8220;On their
first landing, they got the better in fight. The proof
is, that they could not otherwise have fortified their
camp with a wall. Neither does it appear that they
exerted all their strength at once; numbers being
detached for supplies of provisions, to till the Chersonesus,
and to forage at large. Thus, divided as
they were, the Trojans were the better able to make
a ten years&#8217; resistance, being equal in force to those
who were at any time left to carry on the siege.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herodotus treats it, also, as a matter of actual
history: and as the first portion of his work affords
a very curious and beautiful example of ancient
manners, we shall abbreviate the version, rendered
by Mr. Beloe. Paris, having carried off Helen
from Sparta, was returning home (to Troy); but
meeting with contrary winds in the &AElig;gean, he
was driven into the Egyptian Sea. As the winds
continued unfavourable, he proceeded to Egypt,
and was driven to the Canopian mouth of the
Nile, and to Tarichea. In that situation, continues
Herodotus, was a temple of Hercules, &#8220;which still
remains.&#8221; To this temple, should any slave fly for
refuge, no one was permitted to molest him. The
servants of Paris, aware of this privilege, fled thither
from their master. There they propagated many
accusations against him; and, amongst other disclosures,
they published the wrong that Paris had done
to Menelaus. Hearing this, Thonis, the governor of
the district, despatched a messenger to Proteus, king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
of Memphis. &#8220;There is arrived here a Trojan, who
has perpetrated an atrocious crime in Greece. He
has seduced the wife of his host, and carried her
away, with a great quantity of treasure. Adverse
winds have forced him hither. Shall I suffer him to
depart without molestation? or shall I seize his person
and property?&#8221; In answer to this Proteus desired,
that the malefactor should be sent to him.
Receiving this command, Thonis seized Paris, and
detained his vessels, with Helen and all his wealth.
Being taken before Proteus, and asked who he was
and whence he came, Paris gave a true account of his
family and country, and whence he had last sailed.
But when Proteus inquired concerning Helen, who
she was, and how he got possession of her, he faltered.
His servants, however, proved the particulars
of his guilt. On this, Proteus addressed him
after the following manner: &#8220;If I did not esteem it
a very heinous crime to put any stranger to death,
whom unfavourable winds have driven to my coast,
I would, most assuredly, thou most abandoned man,
avenge that Greek whose hospitality thou hast so
treacherously violated. Thou hast not subdued his
wife, but having violently taken her away, still criminally
detainest her; and as if this were not enough,
thou hast robbed and plundered him. But as I can
by no means prevail upon myself to put a stranger
to death, I shall suffer you to depart; in regard
to the woman and her wealth, I shall detain both.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a few observations in respect to Homer&#8217;s
knowing, and yet neglecting, the true history, in order
to make his poem the more interesting, the historian
goes on to relate, that being desirous of knowing
whether all that the Greeks relate concerning Troy
had any foundation in truth, he inquired of the priests
of Egypt; and that they informed him, that, after
the loss of Helen, the Greeks assembled in great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
numbers at Teucris, to assist Menelaus, whence they
despatched ambassadors to Troy, whom Menelaus
himself accompanied. On arriving at that city, they
made a formal demand of Helen, and the wealth
Paris had taken away; and also a general satisfaction
for the injuries received. In answer to this, the
Trojans replied, and persisted in the truth of their
assertion, that neither the person nor the wealth of
Helen was in their city or territory; but that both
were in Egypt; and that they esteemed it hard, that
they should be made responsible for what King Proteus
possessed. The Greeks, however, believing
themselves to be deluded, laid siege to Troy, and,
after ten years, took it.</p>

<p>When they had done so, they were surprised and
chagrined to find, that Helen was not in the captured
town. On learning this, Menelaus himself was despatched
into Egypt, where, being introduced to Proteus,
he was honourably received, and Helen was restored
to him with all his treasures. This is related
by Herodotus as the true history<a name="FNanchor_283_292" id="FNanchor_283_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_292" class="fnanchor">283</a>.</p>

<p>With such testimony it is rather curious, that so
many writers,&mdash;respectable ones too,&mdash;should have
not only doubted the war, but even the existence of
the town against which it was directed. &#8220;We do
not know,&#8221; says Sir John Hobhouse, &#8220;that Strabo had
not himself been in the Troad; but we are sure that
no one could speak more to the purpose than Demetrius,
who was a native of Tcepsis, a town not far
from Ilium, and who wrote thirty books on sixty
lines of Homer&#8217;s catalogue. From this authority we
know, that not a vestige was left of the ancient city.
Neither Julius Cæsar, nor Demetrius, nor Strabo,
had any doubt of the former existence of the city of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>Priam; and the orator Lycurgus, quoted by the
latter author, at the same time that he declared the
total desolation, and as it were death of Troy, to be
known to all the world, spoke of its destruction as
equally notorious.&#8221;</p>

<p>In what manner the city was actually taken is
nowhere upon record; for as to the story of the
wooden horse, it is so absurd, that the judgment
even of Virgil may be arraigned in respect to it.
That it was burned, however, is scarcely to be denied;
and that it was destroyed is not to be doubted.
The event occurred in the year coinciding with that
of 1184 before the Christian era. &#8220;The name of
Priam,&#8221; says a judicious writer, &#8220;will therefore ever
be memorable, on account of the war which happened
in his reign&mdash;a war famous to this day for the many
princes of great prowess and renown concerned in
it, the battles fought, the length of the sieges, the
destruction of the city, and the endless colonies
planted in divers parts of the world by the conquered
as well as by the conquerors.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the Greeks had destroyed the city, they
sailed back to their own country. They made no
attempt to appropriate the land to their own use or
authority. They were, doubtless, not only wearied,
but exhausted, by the conquest. The whole plot of
Virgil is supposed to be no other than a fable; for
Homer signifies that &AElig;neas not only remained in
the country, but that he succeeded to the sceptre
of the Trojans.</p>

<p>From this period the history of the country is
exceedingly obscure. Whether &AElig;neas did succeed
or not, certain it is that this and the adjacent
countries were laid open, at no great distance of time
from the destruction of Troy, an easy and tempting
prey to adventurers, Greek as well as Barbarian.
Among these, the best known are the &AElig;olian colonists,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
who are supposed to have put a final period
not only to the unfortunate city, but to the name of
its people.</p>

<p>The Troia was next invaded by the Ionians and
Lydians; then there was a war between the &AElig;olians
and Athenians about Sigéum<a name="FNanchor_284_293" id="FNanchor_284_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_293" class="fnanchor">284</a> and Achilléum<a name="FNanchor_285_294" id="FNanchor_285_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_294" class="fnanchor">285</a>. This
war was of considerable duration. Several melancholy
circumstances are there related, as arising out
of the possession of the Troia by Darius. Xerxes,
too, visited it during his expedition into Greece, and
the Persians lay one night encamped beneath Mount
Ida. A considerable number of them were destroyed
by thunder and lightning; and on their coming to
the Scamander, that river was found to possess no
water; a circumstance far from being unusual in a
mountainous country. On his arrival at this river,
Xerxes, having a wish to see the Pergamus of
Priam, went thither; and, having listened to the
accounts which were given to him in respect to it,
he sacrificed a thousand oxen to the Ilian Minerva.</p>

<p>Many interesting occurrences are related of Troia
during the first and second Peloponnesian wars.
An adventure of &AElig;schines, the famous orator of
Athens, it may not be unamusing to relate. Dr.
Chandler has given an abstract of the epistle, in
which the orator relates it. It is this:&mdash;&#8220;After
leaving Athens, the author says, that he arrived at
Ilium, where he had intended to stay until he should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>have gone through all the verses in the &#8216;Iliad,&#8217; on
the very spot to which they severally had reference,
but was prevented by the misconduct of his fellow-traveller,
a young rake, named Cymon. It was the
custom, he tells us, for the maidens who were
betrothed, to repair on a certain day to bathe in
the Scamander; among them was at this time
a damsel of illustrious family, called Callirhoe.
&AElig;schines, with their relations and the multitude,
was a spectator of as much of the ceremony as was
allowed to be seen, at a due distance; but Cymon,
who had conceived a bad design against this lady,
personated the River-God, and wearing a crown of
reeds, lay concealed in the thicket, until she, as was
usual, invoked Scamander to receive the offer which
she made of herself to him. He then leaped forth,
saying, &#8216;I, Scamander, willingly accept of Callirhoe;&#8217;
and with many promises of kindness, imposed on
and abused her simplicity and credulity. Four days
after this ceremony, a public festival was held in
honour of Venus, when the females, whose nuptials
had been recently celebrated, appeared in the procession.
&AElig;schines was again a spectator, and Cymon
with him; so when Callirhoe respectfully bowed
her head as she passed by, and, casting her eyes on
her nurse, said, &#8216;that is the God Scamander,&#8217; a discovery
followed. The two companions got to their
lodging and quarrelled, a crowd gathered about the
gate of the house, and &AElig;schines with difficulty made
his escape by the back-door to a place of security.&#8221;</p>

<p>The reader is requested to observe that on the destruction
of old Ilium, another town or rather village was
erected; and that this village was called New Ilium.
This was the place visited by Alexander. It had
only one temple. This temple Alexander visited.
He viewed also all the antiquities which remained.
He poured libations on the altar of Jupiter Hercéus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
to Priam, and prayed that the vengeance which the
gods had taken of the son of Achilles, for having
slain that unfortunate father and king, might not descend
upon him, whose descendant he was. One of
the Ilians offered him a lyre, which he said was the
lyre of Paris; but Alexander refused, saying, &#8220;I
set but little value on the lyre of Paris; but it would
give me great pleasure to see that of Achilles, to
which he sang the glorious actions of the brave;&#8221;
alluding to a passage in the ninth book of the Iliad:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i04">&#8220;Amused, at case, the god-like man they found,</span>
<span class="i0">Pleased with the solemn harp&#8217;s harmonious sound:</span>
<span class="i0">With this he soothes his angry soul, and sings</span>
<span class="i0">The immortal deeds of heroes and of kings.&#8221;</span>
</div></div>

<p>He then desired to be shown the tombs of the heroes.</p>

<p>Quintus Curtius says, that when Alexander arrived
at Illium, Menetius the governor crowned him with
a crown of gold; and that Chares the Athenian
did the same,&mdash;coming from Sigeum for that purpose.
&#8220;Alexander was at length,&#8221; says Mr. Mitford,
&#8220;amidst the scenes, sacred in his eyes, in which
were performed the wondrous deeds that Homer,
his favourite poet, had immortalised. He was treading
on the ground which Achilles, the hero that was
the object of his emulation and envy, fought, and conquered,
and fell. Thoughts, emotions, and wishes,
of the most ardent kind, doubtless swelled his heart
and fired his brain.&#8221; On the site of Troy there
stood only a village. The temple of Minerva, however,
still existed, and thither he proceeded. It contained
some consecrated suits of armour, which were
said to have been preserved there ever since the Trojan
war. One of these he took away to be borne
before him on solemn occasions, and in battle; and
in the place of it he dedicated his own. He performed
rites and made offerings at the tombs of the heroes;
especially those of Achilles and Ajax Telamon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
He adorned the tumulus of Achilles, whom he
regarded as his ancestor, with the choicest flowers
that could be collected in the neighbourhood, anointed
the pillar on it with delicious perfumes, and, with his
companions, ran naked, as the custom was, round its
base. He also wept on reflecting, that he had, as yet,
done little to make men associate his name with so
great a hero as Achilles,&mdash;thinking that hero beyond
all others happy, not only in having so excellent a
friend as Patroclus when living; but inasmuch that
he had so noble a poet as Homer to celebrate him
when dead. &#8220;What a number of writers of his actions,&#8221;
says Cicero, in his defence of Archias, &#8220;is
Alexander reported to have had in his retinue; and
yet, when he stood near the tumulus of Achilles at
Sigeum he exclaimed, &#8216;O fortunate youth! to have
found a Homer to be the herald of thy valour!&#8217;&#8221; Nor
did he ever forget the emotions felt in that, to him,
sacred place. When, therefore, he had conquered the
Persians at the Granicus, he is said to have adorned
the temple with offerings, ordered Curators to repair
the buildings, and raised Ilium to the rank of a city.
He also declared it free from tribute; and when he
had entirely conquered Persia, he wrote a letter to
the inhabitants, promising to raise their town to importance,
to render their temple famous, and to hold
the sacred games there. In his memorandum-book,
also, appeared after his death, a resolution to erect a
temple to Minerva, which should be in splendour
and magnificence, not unequal to any other then existing
in any place. All this was prevented by his
death.</p>

<p>After that occurrence, Ilium was chiefly indebted
to Lysimachus. He enlarged its temple, encircled
the town with walls to the extent of five miles, and
collected into it the inhabitants of the old cities
about it, which had gone to decay. Games also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
were subsequently instituted. He also patronised
Alexandria Troas.</p>

<p>Some time after the Troia was invaded by Philip, last
king of Macedon, because Attalus, who had assumed
the title of King of Pergamum, had given himself
out as an ally of the Romans. At a subsequent
period, the Gauls marched into Ilium; but soon after
deserted it, because part of it was not defended by a
wall.</p>

<p>When Antiochus, commonly called the Great, invaded
Europe, he went to Ilium, in order to sacrifice
to Minerva. The year after, the Roman admiral,
Caius Livius, performed the same ceremony; which
having done he gave audience in the kindest manner
to ambassadors from the neighbouring places, which
had surrendered to the Romans.</p>

<p>Ilium, when Scipio arrived there, (<span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span> 190) was
what we should now call a village-city: and so says
Demetrius of Scepsis; who, going thither about that
time, saw it so poor and neglected a place, that
most of the houses had no roofs on them. Such
is the account given by Strabo. The Romans, however,
were proud of acknowledging the Ilians as
their progenitors. &#8220;An insatiable desire,&#8221; says Dr.
Chandler, &#8220;to contemplate the household gods of
their ancestors, the places of their nativity, the temples
and images, which they had frequented or worshipped,
possessed the Romans; while the Ilians
were delighted that their posterity (in the line of
&AElig;neas) already conquerors of the West and Africa,
laid claim to Asia as the kingdom of their forefathers.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Romans embellished the city, and conferred
many privileges upon it, on the ground that Ilium
was the parent of Rome. &#8220;The Romans,&#8221; says
Justin, &#8220;entering into Asia, came to Troy, where there
was great rejoicing between the Trojans and the Romans;
the Trojans declaring how &AElig;neas came from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
them, and the Romans vaunting themselves to be
descended from them: and there was as great a rejoicement
between both parties, as there is wont to be
at the meeting of parents and children after a long
absence.&#8221;</p>

<p>We now pass to the period when Julius Cæsar,
after the battle of Pharsalia, pursuing his rival, landed
in the Troia, &#8220;full of admiration of the ancient renown
of the place, and desirous to behold the spot
from which he derived his origin;&#8221; for Cæsar insisted
that his family was of the true &AElig;nean race. The
Ilians had sided with Pompey, and bore no great
affection to Cæsar; &#8220;although,&#8221; says Lucan,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i04">&#8220;The tales of Troy proud Cæsar&#8217;s lineage grace,</span>
<span class="i0">With great &AElig;neas and the Julian race.&#8221;</span>
</div></div>

<p>Notwithstanding this, Cæsar forgave their offences
against him, and enlarged their territory, confirmed
their liberties, and granted them even additional privileges.
Not only this; Suetonius relates, that it
was currently reported, that he had contemplated
the design of removing the seat of empire to Ilium,
or Alexandria, and leaving Rome to be governed
by lieutenants. Whether Cæsar really entertained
such an idea is not certain; but it is quite certain
that Augustus entertained a similar project; and
perhaps he had actually put it in practice, had not
Horace written an ode to dissuade him from it; and
his councillors urgently followed the poet&#8217;s example,
by the counsel they gave him.</p>

<p>During the reign of Tiberius, Ilium was visited
by Germanicus. This visit is recorded by Tacitus.
&#8220;On his return from the Euxine, he intended to visit
Samothrace<a name="FNanchor_286_295" id="FNanchor_286_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_295" class="fnanchor">286</a>, famous for its rites and mysteries; but
the wind springing up from the north, he was obliged
to bear away from the coast. He viewed the
ruins of Troy, and the remains of antiquity in that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>part of the world; renowned for so many turns of
fortune, the theatre of illustrious actions, and the
origin of the Roman people<a name="FNanchor_287_296" id="FNanchor_287_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_296" class="fnanchor">287</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the Romans were delivered from the flattery
that pursued the Julian line, of their being sprung
from Troy, Ilium began to fall to decay; and in the
time of Pliny the Elder, who flourished in the reign
of Vespasian, many cities had perished. These are
enumerated by him, and thence by Dr. Chandler:&mdash;&#8220;There
has been Achilleum, a town near the tomb of
Achilles, built by the Mitylenians, and afterwards
by the Athenians. There has been &AElig;antium, too,
built by the Rhodians, near where Ajax was buried.
Palæscepsis, Gergithos, Neandros, and Colone, had
perished. Dardanus is still a small town. There
had been a Larissa and a Chrysa. The Sminthean
temple and Hamaxitus remained.&#8221; He mentions
Troas Alexandria, a Roman colony; but this city,
too, was on the decline; and as, in another place, he
says, &#8220;very many mice came forth at Troas, insomuch
that now they have driven the inhabitants
away from thence.&#8221;</p>

<p>We pass over passages in the works of Lucian
and Philostratus; since no confidence in respect to
the real condition of Ilium can be placed in them.
The extravagances of Caracalla are upon more respectable
record. Terrified by several dreams he had
had, Caracalla voyaged to Pergamum, to inquire of
the god &AElig;sculapius in what manner he could be
relieved from them; from that city he passed to
Ilium. &#8220;At Ilium,&#8221; says Chandler, on the authority
of Herodian, &#8220;Caracalla was seized with a passion
to imitate Achilles, as he had before done Alexander
the Great. He wanted a Patroclus, whose
funeral he might solemnize; when, during his stay
there, Festus, his remembrancer and favourite freedman,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
died of a distemper; but so opportunely, that
others said he was taken off by poison for the purpose.
Caracalla ordered, after the example of Achilles, a
large pile of wood to be collected. The body was
carried forth from the city, and placed on it in the
middle. He slew a variety of animals as victims.
He set fire to the pile; and, holding a phial in his
hand, and pouring a libation, as Achilles had done,
invoked the winds to come and consume it. His
seeking, for he was nearly bald, a lock of hair to
throw into the flames, excited laughter; but the little
which he had he cut off. He is said to have
continued the farce, by allotting prizes for games;
and to have concluded it, by imagining that he had
taken Troy, and distributing money among his soldiers
on the occasion.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the age of Gallienus, and in that subsequent,
Ilium and the Troas were twice ravaged by the
Goths.</p>

<p>The project of Constantine the Great is now to
be referred to. It is thus related by Sozomenus,
translated by Mr. Dalzell:&mdash;&#8220;Having taken possession
of the plain, which lies before Ilium, near the
Hellespont, beyond the tomb of Ajax, where the
Greeks, at the time that they were engaged in the
expedition against Troy, are said to have had a station
for their ships and tents, he there traced the
outline and ground-plot of a city; and he constructed
gates in a conspicuous place; which still at this day
are seen at sea by those who sail along the west.
While he was employed in this undertaking, God
appeared to him by night, and warned him to go in
quest of another place.&#8221; The Deity, also, is said to
have conducted him to Byzantium, and commanded
him to establish his residence there, to enlarge the
town into a city, and to call it by his own name.</p>

<p>From this period, little is related of Ilium, or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
Troas, commanding any peculiar interest, till the
period when both became possessed by another, and,
till then, an unknown people. It is related in the
annals of this new and strange people, that Soliman,
son of Orchan, taking an airing on horseback, in the
country, lately conquered, came to some fine ruins of
edifices, which had remained there from the time of
the destruction of Troy, and which he beheld with
wonder. After viewing these ruins, he was observed
to remain musing and silent. On being asked the
reason, he answered that he was considering how
the sea between them and the opposite coast could
be crossed, without the knowledge of the Christians.
Two of his retinue offered to pass over privately at
the strait, which is described as a Greek mile wide.
A fleet was provided, they landed before day-break,
and lay concealed among vines; until, a Greek
coming by, they seized, and returned with him to
the emperor; who gave orders that their captive
should be kindly treated; and, on his undertaking to
serve as a guide to the castle erected by Justinian,
above Sestos, caused trees to be cut down, and a large
raft to be constructed; on which, with about four-score
men, Soliman crossed the strait; and arriving,
under colour of night, at the fortress, found, without the
entrance&mdash;such was the supine negligence and security
of the Greeks,&mdash;a dunghill as high as the wall. His
soldiers mounted over it, and easily got possession of
the place; the people, a few exempted, being engaged
abroad in the harvest-work. Thus did the Turks
obtain their first footing in Europe, (<span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 1357.)</p>

<p>&#8220;If we reflect,&#8221; says Dr. Chandler; to whose
pages not only ourselves, but all the encyclopedias
have been so largely indebted on all articles relating
to the Troas; &#8220;if we reflect on the ravages, committed
on the borders of the Hellespont, and on the
destruction of the cities there, we shall not be surprised,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
that the coasts are desolate, and that the
interior country of the Troas, returned nearly to its
more ancient state, is occupied almost entirely by villages,
herdsmen, and shepherds; who are no longer
distinguished by the appellation of Ilians, Dardanians,
Cebrenians, and so on; but as Greeks and
Turks, or Turcomans, slaves, the masters and their
dependants. The ancient places, which we have
noticed, and of which few remain, or have possessed
any consequence under the Turks, have all of them,
especially those by the sea-side, been ransacked and
plundered of their materials, for a long series of
years. Constantinople has been adorned or enlarged
from their stores, as well under the Roman and the
Greek as the Mahometan emperors. Towns and
villages, which have risen in their vicinity, public
baths, mosques, castles, and other edifices, have been
constructed from their relics; and the Turkish
burying-grounds, which are often very extensive, are
commonly rich in broken pillars and marble fragments,
once belonging to them. The Troia had
been left in ruins; and was a desert, in the time of
Strabo. Since, in many instances, the very <i>ruins
have perished</i>: but the desert remains; and, as then,
still affords much, and that no vulgar matter for a
writer.&#8221;</p>

<p>These remarks lead us, naturally, to that part of
our subject, which relates to the present state in
which these ruins lie. So much, however, has been
written on the subject of Troy, and so many different
opinions have been started, that the subject
has become no little embarrassing; and the more so,
since the compiler of these pages has not been on
the scene of observation himself. In this dilemma,
he thinks the wisest and best course is, to select such
passages and descriptions as appear to him the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
probable, and therefore the most characteristic of
truth; leaving all references to the individual authorities
to a general acknowledgment at the end.</p>

<p>It seems hardly to admit of doubt, that the plain
of Anatolia, watered by the Mendar,<a name="FNanchor_288_297" id="FNanchor_288_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_297" class="fnanchor">288</a> and backed
by a mountainous ridge, of which Kazdaghy is the
summit, is the precise territory, alluded to and described
by Homer. And this is rendered the more
probable, since Homer&#8217;s description contained certain
prominent and remarkable features, not likely to be
affected by any lapse of time. To increase the probability
of this, the text of Strabo is considered very
important; more especially as it illustrates, to a certain
degree, even the position of Troy itself: for that
it was not altogether unknown, in the time of Augustus,
is proved by that celebrated geographer, who,
more than once, expressly assigns to the ancient city
the place then occupied by the village of the Iliensians.
&#8220;Ilus,&#8221; says he, &#8220;did not build the city where
it now is; but nearly thirty stadia farther eastward,
towards Ida, and Dardania, where the Iliensian village
is now situated.&#8221; This locality of Ilium has
been discovered by Dr. Clarke, in the remains of that
city. Crossing the Mendar, over a wooden bridge,
that celebrated traveller entered an immense plain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>in which some Turks were hunting wild boars.
Proceeding then towards the east, and round the
bay, distinctly pointed out by Strabo as the harbour
in which the Grecian fleet was stationed, he arrived
at the sepulchre of Ajax. Around this tomb Alexander
is described as having performed rites, and
made offerings. In former times, it was surmounted
by a shrine, in which was preserved the statue of the
hero. This statue Antony stole and took with him into
Egypt; but, having been recovered by Augustus, it
was by him restored to its ancient shrine; which,
with a considerable portion of the structure, still
remains. &#8220;It is impossible,&#8221; says Dr. Clarke, &#8220;to
view its sublime and simple form, without calling to
mind the veneration so long paid to it; without picturing
to the imagination a successive series of
kings, and heroes, and mariners, who, from the Hellespont,
or by the shores of Troas and Chersonesus,
or on the sepulchre itself, poured forth the tribute of
their homage; and finally, without representing to
the mind the feelings of a native or of a traveller, in
those times, who, after viewing the existing monument,
and witnessing the instances of public and
of private regard, so constantly bestowed upon it,
should have been told, the age was to arrive when
the existence of Troy, and of the mighty dead,
entombed upon its plain, would be considered as
having no foundation in truth.&#8221; The view of the Hellespont,
and the plain of Troy, from the top of this
tomb, is one of the finest the country affords; and,
travellers have the pleasure of seeing poppies and
mezereons, and the field-star of Bethlehem, growing
upon it.</p>

<p>From this spot the traveller passes over a heathy
country to a village called Habil Elly, where he
finds the remains of a temple, which seems to be those
of ten temples rather than one. Doric, Ionic, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
Corinthian capitals, lie dispersed in every direction,
and some of them are of great beauty. On these are
many inscriptions; amongst which are these remarkable
words:&mdash;&#8220;<i>The Ilians to their country&#8217;s God,
&AElig;neas.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>From these ruins you proceed through a dilapidated
valley, full of vineyards and almond-trees;
and, after a space, you find the remains of an
ancient paved way. You then come to the village
of Tchiblack, where you see many remains of
ancient sculpture in a state of disorder and ruin.
The most remarkable are those upon the top of a
hill near the village, in the middle of a grove of oak
trees. Here the ruins of a Doric temple, formed of
white marble, lay heaped, mixed with sarcophagi,
cippæ, stelæ, cornices, and capitals of large size,
pillars, and entablatures. The village near which
all these are, is supposed to be no other than ancient
Ilium! of &#8220;Troy divine.&#8221; On these fragments are
to be read various inscriptions.</p>

<p>At no great distance, of a high, conical, and
regular shape, a tumulus stands, insulated. It is of
great antiquity. On the southern side of its base is
a long natural mound of limestone. It is, we are
told, of such height, that an army encamped on the
eastern side of it would be concealed from all observation
of persons, stationed upon the coast, by the
mouth of the Mendar. On the surface of the tomb
itself are found fragments of the vases of ancient
Greece;&mdash;a circumstance, attributed to the veneration
paid to the tombs of Troas, in all the ages of
history, until the introduction of Christianity.</p>

<p>At some distance from this tomb is another
tumulus, less considerable. There are ruins, also, on
the southern side of the water, called Callifat<a name="FNanchor_289_298" id="FNanchor_289_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_298" class="fnanchor">289</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span></p>
<p>These consist of beautiful Doric pillars, whose
capitals and shafts are of the finest white marble.
Among them, also, are entire shafts of granite. As
the temples of Jupiter were always of the Doric
order, these are supposed to have belonged to a
temple dedicated to that deity. Among these
ruins was found an inscription, which Dr. Clarke
sent to Cambridge. This is as old as the
archonship of Euclid. It was on the lower
part of a plain marble pillar; the interpretation
of which sets forth, that &#8220;those partaking of
the sacrifice, and of the games, and of the whole
festival, honoured Pytha, daughter of Scamandrotimus,
native of Ilium, who performed the office of
Canephoros, in an exemplary and distinguished
manner, for her piety towards the goddess.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the village of Callifat there are several capitals
of Corinthian pillars. Medals, too, are sometimes
dug up there; not of ancient Troy, however, but of
the Roman emperors. Not far from Callifat are also
to be seen traces of an ancient citadel. These are
the remains of a city, called New Ilium<a name="FNanchor_290_299" id="FNanchor_290_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_299" class="fnanchor">290</a>. &#8220;We
stand,&#8221; says Dr. Clarke, &#8220;with Strabo, upon the
very spot, whence he deduced his observations, concerning
other objects in the district; looking down
upon the Simoisian plain, and viewing the junction
of the two rivers (&#8216;one flowing towards Sigeum,
and the other towards Rhætium,&#8217; precisely as described
by him), in front of the Iliensian city.&#8221;</p>

<p>From the national and artificial elevation of the territory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
on which this city stood, this accomplished
traveller saw almost every landmark to which that
author alludes. &#8220;The splendid spectacle,&#8221; says he,
&#8220;presented towards the west by the snow-clad top
of Samothrace, towering behind Imbrus, would
baffle every attempt at delineation. It rose with
indescribable grandeur beyond all I had seen of a
long time; and whilst its ethereal summit shone
with inconceivable brightness in a sky without a
cloud, seemed, notwithstanding its remote situation,
as if its vastness would overwhelm all Troas, should
an earthquake heave it from its base.&#8221;</p>

<p>Besides these, there are various tumuli in the
Troas, which are distinguished by the names of
Homer&#8217;s heroes; the tomb of Achilles, for instance,
and two others, near the Sigæan promontory, mentioned
by Strabo, &AElig;lian, and Diodorus Siculus.
When Alexander came to visit these, he anointed
the Hêle of Achilles with perfumes; and, as we have
already related, ran naked around it, according to
the custom of honouring the manes of a hero in
ancient times. One of the other tombs was that of
Patroclus. Alexander crowned the one, and his
friend Hephæstion the other<a name="FNanchor_291_300" id="FNanchor_291_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_300" class="fnanchor">291</a>.</p>

</div></div>

<p>These tombs have been so celebrated in all ages,
that we give place, willingly, to a description of
them by Mr. Franklin; more particularly as he
has mentioned several particulars, unnoticed by other
travellers.</p>

<p>Not far from the site of Ilium are to be observed
a number of antiquities, fragments of Doric and
Ionic pillars of marble, some columns of granite,
broken bas-reliefs, and, &#8220;in short,&#8221; says Dr. Clarke,
&#8220;those remains so profusely scattered over this
extraordinary country, serving to prove the number
of cities and temples once the boast of Troas.&#8221;</p>

<p>At no great distance is the steep, which some have
supposed the spot on which stood the citadel of
Priam. On the edge of this is a tumulus, ninety-three
yards in circumference, which is called the
tomb of Hector; it is formed entirely of loose stones.
From this spot the whole isle of Tenedos is seen,
and a most magnificent prospect of the course of
Scamander to the sea, with all Troas, and every
interesting object it contains.</p>

<p>Rather more than one hundred and twenty paces
from this tumulus is another tumulus; the base of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
this is one hundred and thirty-three yards in circumference.
Some little way from this is a third,
ninety yards in circumference. The former is called
the tomb of Priam; the latter the tomb of Paris.
At a short distance farther on are beheld foundations
of buildings; but these are not supposed to be of any
high antiquity, nor even so high as to be classed
with a Roman interdict. They are therefore, with
probability, assigned to those pirates which at
different times have infested the Hellespont. Near
them are tumuli of much higher antiquity; but
whether they belong to Trojan times, or to those in
which the Milesians formed settlements on the coast,
is not determined.</p>

<p>Four hours&#8217; distance from Bonarbashy, situated
on the Scamander, is a town called &AElig;né, the &AElig;neia
of Strabo. It is ornamented with cypresses, and
backed by lofty rocks and mountains. In this town
medals have been found, and some have supposed
that &AElig;neas was buried here; it is, however, more
probable that the town was named after him.</p>

<p>On a hill, in the shape of a cone, at about two
hours&#8217; distance from Beyramitch, towards Gargarus,
are a vast quantity of substances for building; they
may be traced from the bottom to the summit. These
are supposed to have constituted a temple and altar
of Jupiter; the work seems to be Roman. On the
western extremity of the area are remains of baths,
the walls of which are stuccoed; and there are
remaining earthenware conduits still entire in several
places. Above this are tombs, and close to them
a bath; near which lie scattered about several
columns, with broken pieces of amphoræ, marble,
basalt, granite, jasper, and blue chalcedony. At no
great distance off lies the cornice of a Doric entablature,
so large, that M. Preaux said he had seen
nothing like it at Athens.  Higher up are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
remains of another temple, the area of which measures
one hundred and forty yards long and forty-four
wide. These are supposed to be the temple
and altars of Jupiter mentioned by Homer, &AElig;schylus,
and Plutarch. From this spot the view is
represented as being exceedingly grand. &#8220;Immediately
before the eye is spread the whole of Gargarus,
seeming, from its immense size and the vastness
of its features, as if those who were stationed on this
spot might hold converse with persons upon its clear
and sunny summit. Far below is seen the bed and
valley of the Scamander.&#8221;</p>

<p>What kind of a scene is beheld from Gargarus may
be, in some measure, imagined from what Dr. Clarke
says of it. &#8220;In a few minutes I stood upon the
summit. What a spectacle! All European Turkey,
and the whole of Asia Minor, seemed as it were
modelled before me on a vast surface of glass. The
great objects drew my attention first. The eye,
roaming to Constantinople, beheld all the sea of
Marmora, the mountains of Prusa, with Asiatic
Olympus, and all the surrounding territory; comprehending,
in one wide survey, all Propontis and the
Hellespont, with the shores of Thrace and Chersonesus,
all the north of the Egean, Mount Athos, the
islands of Imbrus, Samothrace, Lemnos, Tenedos,
and all beyond, even to Eub&#339;a; the gulf of Smyrna,
almost all Mysia, and Bithynia, with part of Lydia
and Ionia. Looking down upon Troas, it appeared
spread as a lawn before me.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the same district are considerable remains
of the ancient city Alexandria Troas. Long before
the extinction of the Greek empire, this city was
laid under perpetual obligation to contribute, by its
monuments of ancient splendour, towards the public
structures of Constantinople. Notwithstanding
this, there are still some interesting remains; among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
which is to be noted the aqueduct of Herodes Atticus,
formed of blocks of hewn stone of vast size.
Part of one of its gates also remains; consisting of
two round towers, with square basements, supporting
pedestals for statues. At a few yards&#8217; distance
are the ruins of public baths. &#8220;Broken marble soroi
lie about;&#8221; says the intelligent traveller to whom, in
this account, we have been so largely indebted; &#8220;soroi
of such prodigious size, that their fragments seem as
rocks among the Valany oaks covering the soil. But
in all that now exists of this devoted city, there is
nothing so conspicuous as the edifice, vulgarly
termed by the mariners the <i>Palace of Priam</i>; from
an erroneous notion, prevalent in the writings of
early travellers, that Alexandria Troas was the Ilium
of Homer.&#8221;</p>

<p>This building has three noble arches in front, and
there are many others behind. The stones with
which it is constructed are placed without any cement;
and the whole appear to have been once
coated over with marble. There are, also, the bases
of columns, each eight feet in diameter. This building
is supposed to have been intended for baths, as a
grand terminus of the aqueduct of Atticus.</p>

<p>There are other vestiges, also, of this city, amongst
which may be mentioned a series of vaults and subterranean
chambers, one beneath another, now serving
as sheds for tenders, and herds of goats. Towards
the south-west there are remains also of an immense
theatre, still in a state of considerable preservation.
Its diameter is two hundred and fifty feet, and there
is a semicircular range of seats at each extremity.
Towards the port, lower down, are marble soroi,
and other antiquities of less importance.</p>

<p>From this spot, Dr. Clarke proceeded to an immense
tumulus, called after &AElig;syates, the situation of
which, he says, perfectly agrees with the account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
given of that monument by Strabo. He then descended
again into the vale of Troy, and arrived at a
village, called Erkessy, in which he found a marble
soros, quite entire. Upon it is an inscription in
Greek, beautifully cast, and in a very perfect state.
&#8220;<i>Aurelius Agethopodos Othoniacus, and the son of
Aurelius, who was also a Pancratiast, of whom there
is a hollow statue in the temple of Smintheus, and
here in the Temple of &AElig;sculapius, I have placed this
Soros for myself and my dearest father, the afore-written
Amelius Paulinus and to my descendants.
But if any one shall dare to open this Soros, and lay
in it the dead body of any other, or any man&#8217;s bones,
he shall pay, as a fine to the city of the Troadenses,
two thousand five hundred drachms, and to the most
sacred Treasury as much more.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>At no great distance from this soros, Dr. Clarke
found a village, the inhabitants of which live with
great cleanliness in small cottages, and practising
the customs of their forefathers, in their hospitality
to strangers. They presented him with a medal,
found in their village; and they showed him a marble,
on which was an inscription in Greek characters,
implying, that &#8220;<i>Metrodorus of Amphipolis, the son
of Timocles, is praised by the senate and people, for
his virtue and good-will towards the king Antiochus
and Seleucus and the people: he is deemed a benefactor
to the state; is to have access to the senate; and to
be inscribed into the tribe and fraternity to which he
may wish to belong</i><a name="FNanchor_292_301" id="FNanchor_292_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_301" class="fnanchor">292</a>.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<h2>NO. XL.&mdash;TYRE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Tyre</span> is, in Scripture, called &#8220;the daughter of
Sidon,&#8221; and very appropriately; for the Tyrians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>were, in the first instance, a colony from Sidon. It
was built two hundred and forty years before the
building of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The king of Tyre assisted Solomon in procuring
wood for his temple, and artisans wherewith to build
it. Thus it is stated, in the Book of Chronicles:&mdash;</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;3. And Solomon sent to Huram, the king of Tyre, saying,
As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him
cedars to build him an house to dwell therein, even so deal
with me.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;4. Behold, I build an house to the name of the Lord my
God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him sweet incense,
and for the continual shewbread, and for the burnt offerings
morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new
moons, and on the solemn feasts of the Lord our God. This
is an ordinance for ever to Israel.</p>

<p><span class="gesperrt">******</span></p>

<p class="small">&#8220;7. Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold,
and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and
crimson, and blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning
men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David
my father did provide.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;8. Send me also cedar-trees, fir-trees, and algum-trees, out
of Lebanon; for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber
in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants shall be with thy
servants.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;9. Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house
which I am about to build shall be wonderful great.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;10. And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that
cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and
twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths
of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;11. Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which
he sent to Solomon, Because the Lord hath loved his people,
he hath made thee king over them.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;12. Huram said moreover, Blessed be the Lord God of
Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David
the king a wise son, endued with prudence and understanding,
that might build an house for the Lord, and an house for his
kingdom.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;13. And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding,
of Huram my father&#8217;s,</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;14. The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan; and the
father was a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver,
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in
blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner
of graving, and to find out every device which shall be put
to him, with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of
my lord David thy father.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;15. Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the
wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his
servants:</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;16. And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou
shalt need: and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to
Joppa; and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.&#8221;</p>

<p>Various are the opinions concerning the origin of
Tyre, and the date when it was founded. Herodotus
(lib. ii. c. 44) says, that he was told by the priests
of Tyre, that the temple of Hercules was as ancient
as the city, which had been built two thousand three
hundred years. According to this account, Tyre
was founded about the year two thousand seven hundred
and sixty before the Christian era; four hundred
and sixty-nine years after the deluge, according
to the Septuagint<a name="FNanchor_293_302" id="FNanchor_293_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_302" class="fnanchor">293</a>.</p>

<p>Before the captivity of the Jews in Babylon, Tyre
was the greatest maritime city in the world; its
situation and industry having raised it to the sovereignty
of the sea. From the extreme parts of India,
Persia, and Arabia, to the western coast; from
Ethiopia and Egypt on the south, to Scythia on the
north, all nations contributed to the increase of its
power, splendour, and wealth. Every thing that
was useful, and all that was curious, magnificent,
and precious, were there to be sold. Every article
of commerce was brought to its markets.</p>

<p>This state of prosperity swelled the pride of the
Tyrians to a very exorbitant extent. &#8220;She delighted,&#8221;
we are told, &#8220;to consider herself as Queen
of Cities; a queen, whose head is adorned with a
diadem; whose correspondents are illustrious princes;
whose rich traders dispute for superiority with kings;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>who sees every maritime power, either as her allies
or her dependents; and who made herself necessary
or formidable to all nations.&#8221; Such was the pride of
Tyre, when Nebuchadnezzar marched up against her.</p>

<p>Her fate had been foretold by the denunciations of
Ezekiel.</p>

<p class="small">&#8220;I am against thee, O Tyrus, and will cause many nations to
come up against thee, as the sea causes her waves to come up.
And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her
towers. It shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the
midst of the sea; and her daughters shall be slain by the sword.&#8221;
The prophet then discloses who shall be the instrument of all
this destruction. &#8220;I will bring upon Tyrus Nebuchadnezzar,
king of Babylon, a king of kings, with horses, and with chariots,
and with horsemen, and companies of much people.&#8221;
&#8220;He shall set his engines of war against thy walls, and with
his axes he shall break down thy towers.&#8221; &#8220;With the hoofs
of thy horses shall he tread down all thy streets; he shall slay
thy people with the sword, and thy strong garrisons shall go
down to the ground.&#8221; &#8220;And they shall make a spoil of thy
riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise; and they shall
break down thy walls, and destroy thy pleasant houses; and
they shall lay thy stones, and thy timber, and thy dust, in the
midst of the water.&#8221; &#8220;I will cause the noise of thy songs to
cease; and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard.&#8221;
&#8220;Thou shalt be a place to hang nets upon; and shalt be built
no more.&#8221; &#8220;Though thou be sought for, thou shall not be
found.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pride of the Tyrians may be estimated by the
splendour of their ships. These were frequently of
cedar; their benches of ivory; fine embroidered
linens of Egypt were used for sails; and their canopies
were of scarlet and purple silk<a name="FNanchor_294_303" id="FNanchor_294_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_303" class="fnanchor">294</a>. Its trade may
be in some degree imagined, from what is stated as
having been brought to her markets;&mdash;gold, silver,
iron, tin, brass, and lead; slaves<a name="FNanchor_295_304" id="FNanchor_295_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_304" class="fnanchor">295</a>; horses, horsemen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>and mules; sheep and goats; horn, ivory, and ebony;
emeralds, purple, and broidered work; fine linen, and
coral, and agate;&mdash;wheat, honey, oil, and bales of
wares, wine, and wool; cassia and calamus; cloths
for chariots; all manner of spices and precious stones.
All these articles were to be destroyed. &#8220;Thy riches
and thy merchandise, thy mariners and thy pilots,
thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy merchandise,
and all thy men of war that are in thee, and in all
thy company which is in the midst of thee, shall fall
into the midst of the seas, in the days of thy ruin.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prophet then goes on to prophesy how all
the nations shall mourn for her fall. &#8220;Shall not
the isles shake at the sound of thy fall, when the
wounded cry; when the slaughter is made in the
midst of thee? All the princes of the sea shall
come down from their thrones, and lay away their
robes, and put off their embroidered garments; they
shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall
sit upon the ground, and shall tremble at every
moment, and shall be astonished at thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tyre was besieged by Nebuchadnezzar, in the
twenty-first year of his reign; Ithobel being its
king. After seven years he made himself master of
it; not without his troops suffering incredible hardships;
insomuch that, as Ezekiel had predicted,
&#8220;<i>every head was made bald and every head was
peeled</i>.&#8221; Previous, however, to the taking of it, a
multitude of its inhabitants quitted the city, and
took up their abode, with the greatest part of their
effects, in the neighbouring island<a name="FNanchor_296_305" id="FNanchor_296_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_305" class="fnanchor">296</a>, half a mile from
the shore; and in that spot they laid the foundation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>of a new city. When, therefore, Nebuchadnezzar
took possession of the town, he found little in it
to reward him for the trouble, danger, and expense
he had been at during the siege, which lasted thirteen
years. He rased the city to the foundations,
and it was afterwards known only as a village, by
the name of Palæ-Tyrus (ancient Tyre): the new
one rose to greater power than the former one.</p>

<p>The new town, nevertheless, was not remitted of
misfortune; for the inhabitants were made slaves of,
compelled to admit a foreign yoke, and this for the
space of seventy years. After the expiration of that
time, they were restored, according to the prophecy
of Isaiah,<a name="FNanchor_297_306" id="FNanchor_297_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_306" class="fnanchor">297</a> to the possession of their ancient privileges,
with the liberty of having a king of their own,
and that liberty they enjoyed till the time of Alexander.</p>

<p>At that period Tyre had again become an exceedingly
large city; and because of the vast commerce
she carried on with all nations, she was called
&#8220;Queen of the Sea.&#8221; She boasted of having first
invented navigation, and taught mankind the art of
braving the waves and wind. Her happy situation,
the extent and conveniency of her ports, the character
of her inhabitants, who were not only industrious,
laborious, and patient, but extremely courteous to
strangers, invited thither merchants from all parts
of the then-known world: so that it might be considered,
not so much as a city belonging to any
particular nation, as the common city of all nations,
and the centre of their commerce.</p>

<p>Tyre had now for some time risen from the desolation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
into which she had fallen: but with prosperity
came pride, and vain-glory; luxury and
voluptuousness. Another prophet, therefore, foretold
to her a second ruin. She was now &#8220;the
crowning city,&#8221; whose merchants were princes, and
whose traffickers were styled &#8220;the honourable of
the earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tyre had profited nothing from the first lesson:
Another destruction, therefore, was denounced against
her. This was to come from Chittim (Macedonia).
Tyre was careless of this threat. Defended by strong
fortifications, and surrounded on all sides by the sea,
she feared nothing; neither God nor man. Isaiah,
therefore, brings to her recollection the ruin, that
had befallen them in the days of Nebuchadnezzar;
and the destruction which had afterwards fallen on
Babylon itself. &#8220;The inhabitants had raised pompous
palaces, to make their names immortal; but all
those fortifications had become but as dens for wild
beasts to revel in.&#8221; &#8220;The Lord hath purposed it to
stain all the pride of all glory, and to bring into
contempt all the honourable of the earth.&#8221; &#8220;The
Lord hath given a commandment against the merchant
city, to destroy the strong-holds thereof.&#8221;
&#8220;Thou shalt no more rejoice, thou virgin daughter
of Zidon.&#8221; This fall was to come, as we have already
said, from Macedon.</p>

<p>Alexander besieged Tyre seven months;<a name="FNanchor_298_307" id="FNanchor_298_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_307" class="fnanchor">298</a> during
which time he erected vast mounds of earth, plied
it with his engines, and invested it on the side next
the sea with two hundred galleys. When the Tyrians
saw this fleet, they were astonished; because
it greatly exceeded what they had any reason to
expect. They had had in contemplation to send
most of their women and children, with all the men,
who were past the military age, to Carthage: but,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>confident in their strength, they had delayed doing
so; and now they could not spare ships or seamen
to transport them.</p>

<p>A vessel coming from Sidon, they seized upon
the crew, led them to a part of the wall, from
which they could have a full view of the besieging
army, then maliciously put them to death, and
threw their dead bodies over the wall. This
greatly enraged the Macedonian: and he soon after
took possession of the city. According to Plutarch,
the siege terminated in the following manner:&mdash;Alexander
had permitted his main body to rest
themselves, after some great fatigues they had undergone,
and ordered only some small parties to keep
the Tyrians in play. In the mean time, Aristander,
his principal soothsayer, offered sacrifices; and one
day, upon inspecting the entrails of the victims, he
boldly asserted, amongst those about him, that the
city would be taken that month. As the day happened
to be the last of the month, this prediction
was received with great ridicule. Alexander perceiving
the soothsayer to be disconcerted, and having
always made a point of bringing the prophecies of his
soothsayers to completion, he gave orders that the
day should not be called the thirtieth, but the twenty-eighth
of the month. At the same time he called out
his forces by sound of trumpet, and made a much
more vigorous assault than he at first intended.
The attack was violent, and those who were left in
the camp, quitted it to have a share in it, and to
support their fellow soldiers; insomuch that the
Tyrians were forced to give in; and the city was
taken that very day; seven thousand being slain.<a name="FNanchor_299_308" id="FNanchor_299_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_308" class="fnanchor">299</a></p>

<p>The king, with many of the principal men, took
refuge in the temple of Hercules. The lives and
liberties of these were spared; but all others taken,
to the number of thirteen thousand,<a name="FNanchor_300_309" id="FNanchor_300_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_309" class="fnanchor">300</a> were sold to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>slavery for the benefit of the conquering army. To
the eternal ignominy of the conqueror, too, all the
children and women were made slaves of, and all the
young men, that survived the battle, to the amount of
two thousand, were crucified along the sea-shore.
The annals of no nation exhibit an atrocity equal to
this! The city was burned to the ground.</p>

<p>In reference to this stout defence of the Tyrians
against so accomplished a warrior as Alexander, and
their maritime enterprises, a highly eminent scholar
has made the following remarks<a name="FNanchor_301_310" id="FNanchor_301_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_310" class="fnanchor">301</a>:&mdash;&#8220;Let us contemplate
all these great things, as completed by the efforts
of a single city, which, possibly, did not possess a territory
of twenty miles in circumference, which sustained
a siege of thirteen years against all the power
of Babylon; and another of eight months against
Alexander, in the full career of his victories; and
then judge whether a commercial spirit debases the
nature of man, or whether any single city, recorded
in history, is worthy to be compared with Tyre.&#8221;</p>

<p>The buildings were spacious and magnificent;
above all, the temples of Jupiter, Hercules, and
Astarte. These were built by Huram. The walls
were one hundred and fifty feet high, proportionably
broad, and firmly built of large blocks of stone,
bound together with white plaster.</p>

<p>When the conqueror had satiated his vengeance,
he rebuilt it, and planted it anew with people, drawn
from the neighbouring parts; chiefly that he might,
in future times, be called the founder of Tyre.</p>

<p>In the year 313 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span> this new city sustained a
siege against Antigonus; for soon after the death of
Eumenes, Antigonus formed designs against Tyre,
Joppa, and Gaza. The two last soon submitted;
but Tyre gave him great trouble. Being master of
all the other ports on the Ph&#339;nician coasts, he caused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>a vast number of trees to be cut down on Mount
Libanus,&mdash;cedars and cypress trees of great height
and beauty; and these were conveyed to the different
ports, where he commanded a number of ships to be
built, and where he employed in that object several
thousand men. With these, and other ships he received
from Rhodes, Cyprus, and other places, he
made himself master of the sea. Tyre was, therefore,
reduced to great extremities. The fleet of Antigonus
cut off all communication of provisions, and
the city was soon after compelled to capitulate. It
was no longer than nineteen years before this event,
that Alexander had destroyed this city in a manner
as made it natural to believe it would require whole
ages to re-establish it; and yet, in so short a time as
that we speak of, it became capable of sustaining this
new siege, which lasted more than as long again as
that of Alexander. This circumstance discovers the
great resources derived from commerce; for this was
the only expedient by which Tyre rose out of its
ruins, and recovered most of its former splendour.</p>

<p>Isaiah had foretold that Tyre should lie in obscurity
and oblivion for seventy years<a name="FNanchor_302_311" id="FNanchor_302_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_311" class="fnanchor">302</a>. This term
being expired, it recovered its former credit; and, at
the same time, recovered again its former vices. At
length, according to another passage in the same
prophecy<a name="FNanchor_303_312" id="FNanchor_303_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_312" class="fnanchor">303</a>, converted by the preaching of the Christians,
it became a holy and religious city.</p>

<p>After this period it belonged to several masters,
till the time when it was taken possession of by
Antiochus the Great, <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span> 218.</p>

<p>Afterwards it became subject to the Seleucidæ.
It was then sold to a Roman, named Marion, whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>wealth was so great, that he was enabled to purchase
the whole principality. It was still in repute in the
time of Christ, and is, therefore, several times mentioned
in the New Testament.</p>

<p>&#8220;Woe unto thee, Chorazin! Woe unto thee, Bethsaida!
For if the mighty works, which were done in
you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would
have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But
I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for Tyre
and Sidon at the day of judgment than for you.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Matthew</i>,
ch. xi. ver. 21.</p>

<p>&#8220;And from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and
from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and
Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what
great things he did, came to him.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Mark</i>, ch. iii.
ver. 8. <i>Luke</i>, ch. vi. ver. 17.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Herod was highly displeased with them of
Tyre and Sidon; but they came with one accord to
him, and having made Blastus, the king&#8217;s chamberlain,
their friend, desired peace, because their country
was nourished by the king&#8217;s country.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Acts</i>, ch.
xi. ver. 20.</p>

<p>Tyre, in the time of Pliny:&mdash;&#8220;Tyrus, in the olden
time an island, lying almost three quarters of a mile
within the deep sea; but now, through the skill and
labour of Alexander at the siege of it, joined to the
main land. It is greatly renowned; for out of it
have come three other cities of ancient name;&mdash;viz.,
Leptis, Utica, and that great Carthage, which so
long strove with the empire of Rome, for the monarchy
and dominion of the whole world. Not only
these, but the Gades, divided, as it were, from the
rest of the earth, were peopled from thence. Now,
all its glory and reputation arise out of its dye purple
and crimson colours. The compass of it is nineteen
miles, if Palæ-tyrus be included in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a style of architecture called Tyrian;
and of this order Sir C. Wren supposes was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
theatre; by the fall of which, Samson made so great
a slaughter of the Philistines. &#8220;In considering
what this fabric must be,&#8221; says he<a name="FNanchor_304_313" id="FNanchor_304_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_313" class="fnanchor">304</a>, &#8220;that could at
one pull be demolished, I conceive it an oval amphitheatre,
the scene in the middle, where a vast roof of
cedar-beams, resting round upon the walls, centered
all upon one short architrave, that united two cedar
pillars in the middle. One pillar would not be sufficient
to unite the ends of at least one hundred beams
that tended to a centre; therefore, I say, there must
be a short architrave resting upon two pillars, upon
which all the beams tending to the centre of the
amphitheatre might be supported. Now, if Samson,
by his miraculous strength, pressing upon one of
these pillars, moved it from its basis, the whole roof
must of necessity fall.&#8221; The most observable monument
of the Tyrian style is the sepulchre of Absalom,
over against Jerusalem, in the valley of Jehosaphat.</p>

<p>When Tyre fell into the hands of the Romans, it
did not cease to be a flourishing city. It was made
the metropolis of a province by the emperor Hadrian,
who repaired its fortifications, and gave it all the
advantages of a Roman colony.</p>

<p>About <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 639, it fell from the dominion of Rome
into the hands of the Saracens, who remained a considerable
time in possession of it.</p>

<p>On this capture most of the inhabitants emigrated
to Acre. It still remains, we are told by Mr.
Addison, in nearly the same state in which they
abandoned it, with the addition of about a hundred
new stone buildings, occupying a small space to the
north of the peninsula contiguous to the port. Many
parts of the double wall, which encompassed the
island, are still visible, and attest the strength of its
ancient foundations. The isthmus is so completely
covered with sand, washed up by the sea, on either
side, that none but those, acquainted with the history
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>of Tyre, would suppose it to be the work of man.
The peninsula is about a mile long, and half a mile
broad; and its surface is covered with the foundations
of buildings, now nearly all in ruins. On the
western side, where the ground is somewhat more
elevated than the rest, is a citadel, which Mr. Addison
naturally supposes, occupies the site of the ancient
one. On the eastern side, he goes on to observe, are
the remains of a Gothic church, built by the crusaders,
of materials belonging to the temple of Jupiter
Olympus, which was destroyed by Constantine the
Great, or that of Hercules, the tutelary deity of the
ancient Tyrians. Of this only part of the choir
remains. The interior is divided into three aisles,
separated by rows of columns of red granite; of a
kind nowhere else known in Syria. At the extremities
of the two branches of the cross were two
towers, the ascent to which was by a spiral staircase,
which still remains entire. Djezzar, who
stripped all this country to ornament his mosque at
Acre, wished to carry them away; but his engineers
were not able even to move them. This is supposed
to have been the cathedral, of which Eusebius speaks,
calling it the most magnificent temple in Ph&#339;nicia,
and in which the famous William of Tyre was the
first archbishop.</p>

<p>In the second century, it became a bishop&#8217;s see;
and St. Jerome says, that in his time it was not
only the most famous and beautiful city of Ph&#339;nicia,
but a mart for all the nations of the world. It was
dependent upon the patriarch of Antioch; but the
see had no less than fourteen suffragans.</p>

<p>In 1112, Tyre was besieged by the crusaders;
also again in 1124. It was successfully attacked
by Saladin, in 1192; but in 1291, Kabil, sultan of
the Mamelukes, obtained it by capitulation, and
rased its forts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span></p>

<p>Tyre is now called Sur or Sour. For this name
several explanations have been given. We shall
select the most probable, and these are by Volney,
and Dr. Shaw. &#8220;In the name Sour,&#8221; says Volney,
&#8220;we recognise that of Tyre, which we receive from
the Latin; but if we recollect, that the <i>y</i> was formerly
pronounced <i>ou</i>; and observe, that the Latins
have substituted the <i>t</i> for &#952; of the Greeks, and that
the &#952; had the sound of <i>th</i>, in the word <i>think</i>, we
shall be less surprised at the alteration. This has
not happened among the Orientals, who have always
called this place &#8216;Tsour,&#8217; and &#8216;Sour.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Shaw gives a different interpretation:&mdash;&#8220;All
the nations of the Levant call Tyre by its ancient
name <i>Sur</i>, from whence the Latins seem to have
borrowed their <i>Sarra</i>. Sur, I find, layeth claim to
a double interpretation, each of them very natural;
though its rocky situation will prevail, I am persuaded,
with every person who seeth this peninsula,
beyond the <i>Sar</i>, or purple fish, for which it might
afterwards be in such esteem. The purple fish (the
method, at least, of extracting the tincture,) hath
been wanting for many ages; however, amongst a
variety of other shells, the Purpura of Rondeletius
is very common upon the sea shore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Arabians,&#8221; says Mr. Drummond, &#8220;have
always called Tyre <i>Al Sur</i>, the palm-tree. (Gol. <i>in
voce</i>.) Hence, perhaps, the Greeks gave the name
of Ph&#339;nix to this tree, as being the natural production
of Ph&#339;nice; and as being the common emblem
both of the Ph&#339;nicians and of their colonists. It
may have happened, then, that ancient Tyre,
which was situated in a plain, may have been
called <i>Al Sur</i>, as the place where the palm-tree
flourished.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps another explanation may be still more
probable.  Sanchoniathon, as reported by Philo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
Byllius, tells us that Tyre was first inhabited by
Hyp-<i>sour</i>-anios, and that it then consisted of sheds,
built up with canes, rushes, and papyri. From the
middle of this, perhaps, comes the present name,
Hyp-<i>sour</i>-anois.</p>

<p>The palaces of Tyre were for a long period supplanted
by miserable hovels. Poor fishermen inhabited
their vaulted cellars; where, in ancient
times, the treasures of the world were stored.
&#8220;This city,&#8221; says Maundrell, &#8220;standing in the
sea upon a peninsula, promises, at a distance, something
very magnificent. But when you come to it,
you find no similitude of that glory, for which it
was so renowned in ancient times. On the north side
it has an old Turkish ungarrisoned castle; besides
which, you see nothing here but a mere Babel, of
broken walls, pillars, vaults, &amp;c.: there not being
so much as one entire house left. The present inhabitants
are only a few poor wretches, harbouring
themselves in the vaults, and chiefly subsisting upon
fishing; who seem to be preserved, in this place by
Divine Providence, as a visible argument, how God
has fulfilled his word concerning Tyre.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sour, till lately, was a village in the pachalic
of Saide or of Acre; situate on a peninsula, which
projects from the shore, in the form of a mallet with
an oval head. The isthmus which joins it to the
continent is of pure sand. That part of the island
which lies between the village and the sea, that is,
the western side, was laid out in gardens, beset with
weeds. The south side is sandy, and covered with
rubbish. The whole village did not contain more
than fifty families, having huts for houses, crumbling
to pieces.</p>

<p>Dr. Shaw says, that in his time, notwithstanding
Tyre was the chief maritime power of Syria, he
could not perceive the least token of either Cothon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
or harbour, that could, at any time, have been of
any extraordinary capacity. Coasting ships, indeed,
says he, still find a tolerably good shelter from the
northerly winds, under the southern shore; but they
are obliged immediately to retire, when the winds
change to the west or south; so there must, therefore,
have been a better station than this for security
and reception. In the N. N. E. part likewise of
the city, are seen traces of a safe and commodious
basin; but, at the same time, so small as not to
exceed forty yards in diameter. Neither could it
have enjoyed a larger area. Yet this port, small as
it is at present, is notwithstanding so choked up with
sand and rubbish, that even the boats of the poor
fishermen, who visit this once renowned emporium,
can be admitted only with great difficulty. The
sea, however, which usually destroys solid structures,
has not only spared, but enlarged and converted
into a solid isthmus, the mound by which
Alexander joined the isle of Tyre to the continent.</p>

<p>A recent traveller, however, says, &#8220;that in
the angle on which was seated the royal palace,
there are still to be seen a number of fallen granite
pillars, and other vestiges of architectural grandeur;
but of the temples of the Tyrian and the Thracian
Hercules, of Saturn, of Apollo, and of their other
deities, I am not aware that sufficient remains are to
be traced to confirm the positions assigned to them.
The causeway of Alexander is still perfect, and
is become like a natural isthmus, by its being covered
over with sand. The hill, on which is placed the
temple of the Astrochitonian Hercules, is now occupied
by a Mohammedan faqueer&#8217;s tomb, around
which are no ruins that indicate a work of grandeur
destroyed. The ruins of Palæ-tyrus, near to
Ras-el-ain, were not observed by me, although we
crossed the brook there; and the Syrian sepulchres,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
which are said to be to the northward of the town,
I did not hear of. On approaching the modern
Sour, whether from the hills, from the north or from
the south, its appearance has nothing of magnificence.
On entering the town, it is discovered to have been
walled; the portion towards the isthmus still remaining,
and being entered by an humble gate;
while that on the north side is broken down, showing
only detached fragments of circular towers, greatly
dilapidated.&#8221; &#8220;They do not reach beyond the precincts
of the present town; thus shutting out all the
range to the northward of the harbour, which
appears to have been composed of the ruins of former
buildings.&#8221; &#8220;The tower to the south-east is not
more than fifty feet square, and about the same
height. It is turreted to the top, and has small
windows and loop-holes on each of its sides. A
flight of steps leads up to it from without, and its
whole appearance is like that of the Saracenic buildings
in the neighbourhood of Cairo.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sour has greatly risen of late years. It now contains
eight hundred dwellings, substantially built of
stone; most of which have courts, walls, and various
conveniences, attached to them; besides smaller habitations
for the poor. There are, also, one mosque,
three Christian churches, three bazaars, and a bath.
This intelligence is furnished by Mr. Buckingham,
who was there in the earlier part of 1816. He adds
also, that the population amounts, at the lowest
computation, from five to six thousand; three-fourths
of which are Arab catholics, and the remainder
Turks and Arab moslems.</p>

<p>In Tyre was interred the well-known Frederic the
First, surnamed Barbarossa (<span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 1190)<a name="FNanchor_305_314" id="FNanchor_305_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_314" class="fnanchor">305</a>.</p>

<h2>NO. XLI.&mdash;VEII</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> memory of Veii<a name="FNanchor_306_315" id="FNanchor_306_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_315" class="fnanchor">306</a> was almost obliterated in
the time of Florus. The flock had fed in the streets,
and the ploughshare had furrowed the sepulchres of
the Veientes<a name="FNanchor_307_316" id="FNanchor_307_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_316" class="fnanchor">307</a>.</p>

<p>The history of Veii is too imperfect, to throw any
light, prior to the existence of Rome. We are
only informed, that Morrius, king of Veii, was
descended, by Halæsius, from Neptune; and that
there was a king Veius, a king Menalus, and lastly,
in the time of Camillus, an elected king named
Tolemarius.</p>

<p>Veii was a powerful city of Etruria; large enough
to contend with Rome in the time of Servius Tullus;
and Dionysius of Halicarnassus says, that it was
equal in extent to Athens; and Sir W. Gell quotes a
passage from a fragment of the same writer, published
by Mai at Milan, 1816, in which he speaks thus of
Veii and its territory:&mdash;&#8220;The city of Veii was not
inferior to Rome itself in buildings, and possessed a
large and fruitful territory, partly mountainous, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>partly in the plain. The air was pure and healthy,
the country being free from the vicinity of marshes,
and without any river, which might render the
morning air too rigid. Nevertheless, there was an
abundance of water; not artificially conducted, but
rising from natural springs, and good to drink.&#8221;
(Lib. xii. frag. 21).</p>

<p>In the course of three hundred and fifty years it
carried on no less than sixteen wars with Rome,
but was at last taken and destroyed by Camillus,
after a siege of ten years. This was the most important
of the conquests of the infant republic. Its
situation was so eligible, that the Romans, after the
burning of their city by the Gauls, were long inclined
to emigrate there, and totally abandon their homes;
and this would have been carried into execution,
but for the authority and eloquence of Camillus<a name="FNanchor_308_317" id="FNanchor_308_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_317" class="fnanchor">308</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is lamentable,&#8221; says Sir W. Gell, &#8220;that in
a country so little cultivated, interesting traces of
antiquity, tending to confirm the truth of history,
should be suffered to disappear almost without
record, for the sake of a miserable and narrow stripe
of corn, and a few volcanic stones for mending the
roads. The site of the citadel of Veii affords ample
testimony to the accuracy of the description of Dionysius,
who says it stood upon a high and precipitous
rock. Not far from the road (from Rome) several
large square blocks, concealed by soil and bushes,
may easily be detected by persons accustomed to
antiquarian researches. A heap of ruins are seen,
supposed to have been a temple dedicated to Juno;
and among these lay, in 1830, a piece of marble,
relating to the family of Tarquitia, a race of celebrated
Tuscan augurs, from whose books the soothsayers
took their lessons, even so low down as the
last war of the emperor Julian with the Persians.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span></p>
<p>There exists, also, a large tumulus, supposed to be
the tomb of Propertius, king of Etruria, founder of
the city.</p>

<p>In a rock under the ancient wall are several niches,
which have the appearance of places for urns, or
votive offerings; not of Roman construction, but
Etrurian. There are, also, evident traces of one or
two bridges; and on the summit of a hill, at the
distance of three miles, is another tumulus.</p>

<p>In another part the rugged extent of the rocks,
with the bushes, and the difficulty of carrying away
the blocks, have preserved portions of the ancient
wall of the Etruscan Veii. These are ten or eleven
feet in length, and some more than five feet in height.
One of the most singular facts attending this wall,
is a bed of three courses of bricks, each three feet in
length, intervening between the lower course of the
wall, and the rock upon which it is built. It requires
only a very moderate knowledge of the subject
to convince us, that the construction of this wall has
no resemblance to anything remaining at Rome, nor
yet at Nepi, Falerii, or Tarquinii, where the ramparts
were in smaller blocks, and nearly regular. The
style of the fortifications at Veii bespeak a much
higher antiquity.</p>

<p>Added to what we have already stated, there are
vestiges of ancient fortifications and aqueducts, and

There are, also, tombs in a glen near, and upon the
rock, called Isola, exhibiting every kind of sepulchral
excavation; caves, columbaria, and tombs without
number. This was, no doubt, the metropolis of
Veii.</p>

<p>There are, also, the remains of other tumuli, which
appear to have been the common receptacle of those
slain in battle, rather than of remarkable individuals.
These all mark the date of Veii in the elder times; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>

<p>&#8220;The remains of this once populous Etruscan city,&#8221;
says Sir William Gell, &#8220;have, in the course of
the last ten years, suffered so lamentably from spoliations,
perpetrated or permitted by the owners of
the soil, that it is necessary to take particular notice
of such relics as still attest the existence of a place of
so much importance in the early history of Italy.&#8221;</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_23_23" id="Footnote_23_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> The character of Sardanapalus has been treated more gently by
a modern poet. &#8220;The Sardanapalus of Lord Byron is pretty
nearly such a person as the Sardanapalus of history may be supposed
to have been,&mdash;young, thoughtless, spoiled by flattery and
unbounded self-indulgence; but, with a temper naturally amiable,
and abilities of a superior order, he affects to undervalue the sanguinary
renown of his ancestors, as an excuse for inattention to
the most necessary duties of his rank; and flatters himself, while
he is indulging his own sloth, that he is making his people happy.
Yet, even in his fondness for pleasure, there lurks a love of contradiction.
Of the whole picture, selfishness is the prevailing
feature;&mdash;selfishness admirably drawn, indeed; apologised for by
every palliating circumstance of education and habit, and clothed
in the brightest colours of which it is susceptible, from youth,
talents, and placidity. But it is selfishness still; and we should
have been tempted to quarrel with the art which made vice and
frivolity thus amiable, if Lord Byron had not, at the same time,
pointed out with much skill the bitterness and weariness of spirit
which inevitably wait on such a character; and if he had not given
a fine contrast to the picture, in the accompanying portraits of
Salamenes and Myrrha.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Heber.</span></p></div>

Queenhithe, preached a sermon before the Lord Mayor and corporation
of London, in which he instituted a parallel between the
cities of London and Nineveh, to show that unless the inhabitants
of the former repented of their many public and private vices, and
reformed their lives and manners, as did the Ninevites on the
preaching of Jonah, they might justly be expected to become the
objects of the signal vengeance of Heaven: putting them in mind
of the many dreadful calamities that have, from time to time,
befallen the English nation in general, and the great City of London
in particular; and of the too great reason there was to apprehend
some yet more signal vengeance from the hands of Omnipotence,
since former judgments had not proved examples sufficient to warn
and amend a very wicked people.</p></div>

&#8220;a garden, full of palm-trees;&#8221; but when Mr. Wood
was there, not a single one remained. &#8220;The name of Palmyra,&#8221;
says Mr. Addison, &#8220;is supposed by some to have been derived from
the word Palma, indicative of the number of palm-trees that grew
here; but that name was given by the Greeks, and, although
Palma signifies palm-tree in the Latin, yet in the Greek tongue it
has a very different signification. Neither does Tadmor signify
palm-tree in the Syrian language, nor in the Arabic; nor does
Thadamoura, as the place is called by Josephus, signify palm-tree in
the Hebrew. Neither do palms thrive in Syria, as the climate is
too severe for them in the winter.&#8221;</p></div>

strong. If we add to this an uncommon strength, and consider her
excessive military fatigues; for she used no carriage, generally rode,
and often marched on foot three or four miles with her army; and
if we, at the same time, suppose her haranguing her troops, which
she used to do in her helmet, and often with her arms bare, it will
give us an idea of that severe character of masculine beauty, which

Moullab Ackber&#8217;s MSS., which may serve to diversify our page.
&#8220;Jemsheed was the first who discovered wine. He was immoderately
fond of grapes, and desired to preserve some; which were placed
in a large vessel, and lodged in a vault for future use. When the
vessel was opened, the grapes had fermented. Their juice, in this
state, was so acid, that the king believed it must be poisonous. He
had some vessels filled with it, and poison written upon each:
these were placed in his bed-room. It happened that one of his
favourite ladies was affected with nervous head-aches. The pain
distracted her so much, that she desired death; and observing a
vessel with the word poison written upon it, she took it and
swallowed its contents. The wine, for such it had become, overpowered
the lady, who fell into a sound sleep, and awoke much
refreshed. Delighted with the remedy, she repeated the dose so
often, that the monarch&#8217;s poison was all drunk. He soon discovered
this, and forced the lady to confess what she had done.
A quantity of wine was made; and Jemsheed, and all his court,
drank of the new beverage, which, from the circumstance that
led to its discovery, is to this day known in Persia by the name
of zeher-e-khoosh, or the delightful poison.&#8221;</p></div>

regard to the infancy and old age of nations, written by M. Claret
Fleurien:&mdash;&#8220;If we are not disposed to challenge all the testimonies
of antiquity, we cannot refuse to believe that the Old World has had
its infancy and its adolescence: and, observing it in its progressive
career, we may consider it as in its maturity, and foresee, in an
unlimited time, its decrepitude and its end. The New World, like
the Old, must have had its periods. America, at the epoch of its discovery,
appears as if little remote from creation, from infancy, if we
consider it in regard to the men by whom it was inhabited: the
greater part of its people were still at the point where our ancestors
and those of all the nations, at this day civilised, were four thousand
years ago. Read what travellers and historians have related to us
of the inhabitants of the New World; you will there find the man
of the Old one in his infancy: among the small scattered nations,
you will fancy that you see the first Egyptians; wild and savage men,
living at random, ignorant of the conveniences of life, even of the
use of fire, and not knowing how to form arms for defending themselves
against the attack of beasts<a name="FNanchor_A_96" id="FNanchor_A_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_96" class="fnanchor">a</a>: in the Pesserais of Tierra del
Fuego, the savage Greeks, living on the leaves of trees, and, as it were,
browsing on grass, before Pelasgus had taught the Arcadians to construct
huts, to clothe themselves with the skin of animals, and to eat
acorns<a name="FNanchor_B_97" id="FNanchor_B_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_97" class="fnanchor">b</a>: in the greater part of the savages of Canada, the ancient
Scythians, cutting off the hair of their vanquished enemies, and drinking
their blood out of their skull<a name="FNanchor_C_98" id="FNanchor_C_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_98" class="fnanchor">c</a>: in several of the nations of the
north and south, the inhabitant of the East Indies, ignorant of culture,
subsisting only on fruits, covered with skins of beasts, and killing
the old men and the infirm, who could no longer follow in their
excursions the rest of the family<a name="FNanchor_D_99" id="FNanchor_D_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_99" class="fnanchor">d</a>: in Mexico, you will recognize
the Cimbri and the Scythians, burying alive with the dead king the
great officers of the crown<a name="FNanchor_E_100" id="FNanchor_E_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_100" class="fnanchor">e</a>: in Peru as well as Mexico, and even
among the small nations, you will find Druids, Vates, Eubages,
mountebanks, cheating priests and credulous men<a name="FNanchor_F_101" id="FNanchor_F_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_101" class="fnanchor">f</a>: on every part
of the Continent and in the neighbouring islands, you will see the
Bretons or Britons, the Picts of the Romans, and the Thracians,
men and women, painting their body and face, puncturing and making
incisions in their skin; and the latter condemning their women
to till the ground, to carry heavy burdens, and imposing on them
the most laborious employments<a name="FNanchor_G_102" id="FNanchor_G_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_102" class="fnanchor">g</a>: in the forests of Canada, in the
Brazils, and elsewhere, you will find Cantabri causing their enemies
whom they have made prisoners of war to undergo torture, and
singing the song of the dead round the stake where the victim is
expiring in the most frightful torments<a name="FNanchor_H_103" id="FNanchor_H_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_103" class="fnanchor">h</a>: in short, every where,
America will present to you the horrible spectacle of those human
sacrifices, with which the people of both worlds have polluted the
whole surface of the globe; and several nations of the New World,
like some of those of the Old<a name="FNanchor_I_104" id="FNanchor_I_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_104" class="fnanchor">i</a>, will make you shrink with horror
at the sight of those execrable festivals, where man feeds with
delight on the flesh of his fellow-creature. The picture which the
New World exhibited to the men of the Old who discovered it,
therefore, offered no feature of which our history does not furnish us
with a model in the infancy of our political societies.&#8221;</p></div>

and maintained with constant care, roads diverging from the capital
to the extremities of the empire. The good condition of these was
thought to be of such importance, that the charge was only entrusted
to persons of the highest dignity, and Augustus himself assumed the
care of those in the neighbourhood of Rome. The expense of their
construction was enormous, but they were built to last for ever, and
to this day remain entire and level, in many parts of the world, where
they have not been exposed to destructive violence. They usually
were raised some height above the ground which they traversed, and
proceeded in as straight a line as possible, running over hill and valley
with a sovereign contempt for all the principles of engineering.
They consisted of three distinct layers of materials; the lowest, stones
mixed with cement, (<i>statumen</i>); the middle, gravel or small stones,
(<i>rudera</i>), to prepare a level and unyielding surface to receive the
upper and most important structure, which consisted of large masses
accurately fitted together. It is curious to observe that, after many
ages of imperfect paving, we have returned to the same plan. The new
pavement of Cheapside and Holborn is based in the same way upon
broken granite, instead of loose earth which is constantly working
through the interstices, and vitiating the solid bearing which the
stones should possess. A further security against its working into
holes is given by dressing each stone accurately to the same breadth,
and into the form of a wedge, like the voussoirs of an arch, so that
each tier of stones spans the street like a bridge. This is an improvement
on the Roman system: they depended for the solidity
of their construction on the size of their blocks, which were irregularly
shaped, although carefully and firmly fitted. These roads,
especially in the neighbourhood of cities, had, on both sides, raised
footways (<i>margines</i>), protected by curb-stones, which defined the
extent of the central part (<i>agger</i>) for carriages. The latter was
barrelled, that no water might lie upon it.&mdash;<i>Gell.</i></p></div>

that very empire, by introducing into Rome, by the wealth it
brought into it, a taste and love for luxury and effeminate pleasures;
for it is from the victory over Antiochus, and the conquest of
Asia, that Pliny dates the depravity and corruption of manners in
the republic of Rome, and the fatal changes which ensued.
Asia, vanquished by the Roman arms, afterwards vanquished
Rome by its vices. Foreign wealth extinguished in that city a
love for the ancient poverty and simplicity, in which its strength
and honour consisted. Luxury, that in a manner entered Rome
in triumph with the superb spoils of Asia, brought with her in her
train irregularities and crimes of every kind, made greater havoc in
the city than the mightiest armies could have done, and in that
manner avenged the conquered globe.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Rollin.</span></p></div>

by Phidias and Praxiteles, on Monte Cavallo,&#8221; says Mr. Williams,
&#8220;are superior to all the statues of that description which I have
seen in Italy. Both of the figures are in the act of guiding their
horses, and are remarkable for lightness and manly beauty; suggesting
no idea of huge blocks of marble, as most of the colossal
statues do. The proportions of these figures are exquisite, and
from certain points appear little inferior to the finest statues in
the world. The horses, however, are not so well proportioned.
That the sculptors might give dignity to the figures, they have made
the horses comparatively small&mdash;a liberty which will not be condemned
by the judicious critic.&#8221;</p></div>

year 1084, when Robert Guiscard visited the city, this spot, so
famous, was despoiled of all its ornaments; and the buildings having
been in great part ruined, it has served from that time to our
days as a market for oxen and cows, whence is derived the name
of <i>Campo Vaccino</i> (cow-field), under which it was lately known.
At the present day, however, it has lost that vile denomination, and
obtained again the appellation of <i>Forum Romanum</i>.&#8221; Mr.
Woods, however, says, that it was called <i>Campo Vaccino</i>, not as
being the market, but as the place where the long-horned oxen,
which have drawn the carts of the country-people to Rome, wait till
their masters are ready to go back again. Vasi is mistaken, in saying
that &#8220;this vile denomination&#8221; has been lost; it never will be
lost&mdash;it is too accurately descriptive&mdash;it tells the tale of degradation
too well, not to last as long as the Forum remains. Nor would it
be correct to call the space marked <i>Campo Vaccino</i>, in the modern
maps of Rome, by the name of <i>Forum Romanum</i>,&mdash;or <i>Foro
Romano</i>, to use the Italian form. The Campo Vaccino is a much
larger space than the existing remnant of the ancient Forum; and
though it is quite correct to call that remnant a part of the Campo
Vaccino, yet to call the Campo Vaccino the Forum Romanum,
would give rise to very incorrect notions concerning the limits and
site of the ancient Forum.&mdash;Anon.</p></div>

chiefly for the centumviri, or the judges to sit in and hear
causes, and for the counsellors to receive clients. The bankers,
too, had one part of it allotted for their residence. Vossius has
observed, that these Basilicæ were exactly in the shape of our
churches, oblong almost like a ship; which was the reason that upon
the ruin of so many of them Christian churches were several times
raised on the old foundations, and very often a whole Basilica
converted to such a pious use; and hence, perhaps, all our great
domos or cathedrals are still called Basilicæ.</p></div>

but was only contemned by his subjects, in the beginning of his
reign. He was not insensible of this; but nevertheless thought it
his interest to subdue their tempers by an artful carriage, and win
their affection by gentleness and reason. He had a golden cistern
in which himself, and those persons who were admitted to his table,
used to wash their feet: he melted it down, and had it cast into a
statue, and then exposed the new god to public worship. The people
hastened in crowds to pay their adoration to the statue. The
king, having assembled the people, informed them of the vile uses
to which this statue had once been put, which nevertheless had now
their religious prostrations. The application was easy, and had the
desired success; the people thenceforward paid the king all the respect
that is due to majesty.

He always used to devote the whole morning to public affairs,
in order to receive petitions, give audience, pronounce sentence, and
hold his councils: the rest of the day was given to pleasure; and
as <i>Amasis</i>, in hours of diversion, was extremely gay, and seemed
to carry his mirth beyond due bounds, his courtiers took the liberty
to represent to him the unsuitableness of such a behaviour; when
he answered, that it was as impossible for the mind to be always serious
and intent upon business, as for a bow to continue always bent.

It was this king who obliged the inhabitants of every town to enter

origin, who made an invasion on the more southern provinces of
Asia, and at last fixed their residence near Hyrcania. They remained
long unnoticed, and even unknown, and became successively
tributary to the empire of the Assyrians, then of the Medes, and
thirdly, of Persia.
</p>
<p>
When Alexander invaded Persia, the Parthians submitted to his
authority, like other cities of Asia. After his death, they fell successively
under the power of Eumenes, Antigonus, Seleucus Nicanor,
and Antiochus. At length, in consequence of the rapacity
of Antiochus&#8217;s lieutenant, whose name was Agathocles, Arsaces, a
man of great military powers, raised a revolt, and subsequently
founded the Parthian empire, about two hundred and fifty years
before the Christian era. Arsaces&#8217; successors were called, after
him, the Arsacidæ.</p></div>

These five statues were all that were found belonging to the eastern

destination and design; and it is the more to be lamented, as that
was the principal façade of the edifice, and contained the great
entrance into the soros of the temple. This front was by far the
most magnificent in its decorations; the esplanade before it extending
one hundred, while that of the western was but fifty feet; the
statues also on this tympanum were more numerous, there being
originally on this fourteen figures, and but eleven on the other;
they are also both in style and sculpture far superior, and appear
as the work of the master, the others, in comparison, as those of the
scholars. The superiority of conception and manner is apparent, the
forms are more muscular and robust, the veins and muscles more
displayed, an imitation of a maturer nature. At the first opening
of the ruins twenty-five statues were discovered, besides the four
female figures belonging to the Acroteria. To the artist the canon
of proportion and the system of anatomical expression observable
throughout the whole may be regarded as the models whence was
derived that still bolder style of conception which afterwards
distinguished the sculptors and made the perfection of the Athenian
school; what the works of Ghulandia were to Raphael, these were
to Phidias. The surprise of the common observer may be excited
when he contemplates these figures, however disadvantageous the
circumstances under which he views them. Perhaps he cannot call
to mind in the capital of his country, however civilisation and the
arts may have advanced, any sculptures of the nineteenth century
which appear equally imposing; the more so, when he reflects that
the history of their origin is buried in the darkness of two thousand
four hundred years. Long after this period Lysippus held as a
principal of the ideal which has in later times been too generally
followed, to make men as they seem to be, not as they really are.
In this group there is not, as seen in the opposite one, any figure
immediately under the centre of the tympanum; that of Minerva,
which was found, and which, no doubt, had occupied it, being
thought too much broken to be placed. The one nearest is the
figure of a warrior, who appears as having fallen wounded to the
ground. He is supporting himself on the right arm, endeavouring
to rise. The hand no doubt held a sword, as the rivets of bronze
still remaining indicate. On the left arm is a shield held close to
the body, the hand enclasping the &#964;&#949;&#955;&#945;&#956;&#8061;&#957;, or holder. The countenance,
contrary to the one in a similar position on the opposite
pediment, seems calmly to regard, and to mark the moment to
resist with any chance of success an advancing adversary, who
is rushing forward to seize his spoils. Whether this statue is
rightly placed we think will admit of doubt. The figure rushing
forward could not have inflicted the wound by which he has
been disabled, and it seems more probable that an arrow, which
an archer at the extreme of the pediment has just discharged,
has been the cause of his wound, and that it should, instead of
being on the ground, have been placed as if in the act of falling.
In the attitude of the attacking warrior, a desire is shown
to give the greatest interest to the action; the position of the
right leg seems calculated to give movement to the figure as
seen from below; behind the fallen an unarmed figure is stooping
forward, apparently to raise him; but this statue would seem
rather to belong to the other pediment, where a hollow is found
in the pedestal on which the Goddess Minerva stands, which appears
to have been made to allow room for its advance. Among the
statues found, but broken, was one which stood nearly over the
body of the wounded hero, to defend him against the advancing
enemy before mentioned. Near the archer is another combatant
on the ground; the countenance of this figure is aged, the beard
most minutely sculptured; it is of a square form, and descends to
the breast; on the lip are long mustachios. It is by far the most
aged of either group, and appears to be a chief of consequence; he
is raising himself on his shield; the expression of the face is very
fine, it has a smile on it, though evidently in pain. The archer is
a Phrygian, and his body is protected by leathern armour; as he
has no shield allowed, he is holding the bow, which is small and of
the Indian shape, in the left hand, with the arm outstretched; the
bow-string has been drawn to the ear, the arrow seems just to have
sped, and the exultation of the countenance shows it has taken
effect. Three of these figures have that sort of helmet which defends
the face by a guard descending over the nose, and the back
by the length of the &#955;&#8057;&#966;&#959;&#962;, or crest, or horsehair, <i>crista</i>; the shields
are massy and large, they are the Argive &#7936;&#963;&#960;&#8054;&#962; &#7956;&#947;&#954;&#965;&#954;&#955;&#959;&#962;, circular
shields, and the handles are nicely framed. The inside of all of
them were painted in red colour, and within a circle of the exterior
a blue colour was seen, on which was pictured, without doubt, the
symbol adopted by the hero; for on a fragment of one of those belonging
to this front was in relief a part of a female figure. The
remaining figures belonging to this tympanum, the fragments of
which were found, were principally archers.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Those statues offer the only illustration now extant of the
armour of the heroic ages. The bodies of all the figures of this pediment,
with the exception of the archer who is encased in leathern
armour, are uncovered. The great minuteness of execution in
the details corresponds with the exactness which &AElig;schylus,
Homer, and the earlier writers of the heroic age have preserved in
their descriptions; in the whole of these statues this is observable
in every tie and fastening. It would appear that the whole had undergone
the strictest scrutiny; as, in each, those parts which, from
their position on the building, could not have been seen, are found
equally exact: in every particular they are the same as those which
are traced on the vases of the most Archaic style, where they are
delineated in black on a red ground, as is seen in the Museum collection.
The two female figures on the apex of the pediment are
clothed; the drapery falls in thick folds around the figure; in their
hands they hold the pomegranate flower; the feet are on a small
plinth; they are the &#7960;&#955;&#960;&#8055;&#962; of the Greeks, the Goddess of Hope,
so well known in museums and on coins, and their situation here
is peculiarly appropriate, as presiding over an undecided combat. It
does not appear that any of the figures on either pediment had any
support to fix them in position but the cornice where they came in
contact with it; they must all have been easily removable; and
perhaps it may not be unreasonable to suppose, that on particular
festivals they were so disposed as to represent the actions then in
celebration, to recall to the imagination of the votaries the reason
for those sacrifices then offered to the god who presided over the
temple. This would account why almost all the celebrated groups of
antiquity, which have decorated the façades of their sacred edifices,
among which may be reckoned those of the Parthenon, the Sicilian
Adrimetum, and the &AElig;gina, are so completely finished, and shows
how what would otherwise seem a waste both of talent and labour,
was brought to account.&#8221;</p></div>

duty or to the occasion; but he appears not to have possessed the
daring and generous spirit of a hero, who courts danger and fame,
disdains artifice, and boldly challenges the allegiance of his equals.
His abilities were useful rather than splendid; a vigorous mind,
improved by the experience and study of mankind; dexterity and
application in business; a judicious mixture of liberality and
economy; steadiness to pursue his ends; flexibility to vary his
means; and, above all, the great art of submitting his own passions,
as well as those of others, to the interest of his ambition, and of
colouring his ambition with the most specious pretences of justice
and public utility.  Like Augustus, Diocletian may be considered
as the founder of a new empire; like the adopted son of Cæsar, he
was distinguished as a statesman rather than a warrior; nor did
either of those princes employ force whenever their purpose could
be effected by policy.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gibbon.</span></p></div>

the kindest treatment from the Egyptians; but after his death, say
the Scriptures, there arose up a new king, which knew not Joseph.
Rameses-Miamun, according to archbishop Usher, was the name of
this king, who is called Pharaoh in scripture. He reigned sixty-six
years, and oppressed the Israelites in a most cruel manner. He
set over them task-masters, to afflict them with their burdens. &#8220;And
they built for Pharaoh treasure-cities, Pithom and Raamses; and
the Egyptians made the children of Israel serve with rigour, and
they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar and in
brick, and in all manner of service in the field; all their service
wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Prideaux.</span></p></div>

Mendar, startling young broods of ducks, and flocks of turtle-doves,
out of every bush. Nothing could be more agreeable
than our frequent rambles along the banks of this beautiful
stream. The peasants of the numerous villages, whom we frequently
encountered ploughing with their buffaloes, or driving
their creaking wicker cars laden with faggots from the mountains,
whether Greeks or Turks, showed no inclination to interrupt our
pursuits. The whole region was, in a manner, in possession of the
Salsette&#8217;s men, parties of whom, in their white summer dresses,
might be seen scattered over the plain, collecting the tortoises
which swarm on the sides of the rivulet, and are found under
every furze-bush.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">LETTER</span> XXXIX. 4to.</p></div>

fell from its banks into the water, as well as from the

animals,&mdash;of all others the least adapted to climb trees,&mdash;had singularly
obtained a footing. Wild-fowl, also, were in abundance.</p></div>

classical regions, that any adequate idea can be formed of Homer&#8217;s
powers as a painter. Neptune, placed on the top of Samothrace,
commanding a prospect of Ida, Troy, and the fleet, observes Jupiter
upon Gargarus turn his back upon Troas. What is intended by this
averted posture of the God, other than that Gargarus was partially
concealed by a cloud, while Samothrace remained unveiled? a circumstance
so often realised. All the march of Juno, from
Olympus, by Pieria and &AElig;mathia to Atlas, by sea, to Lemnos;
and thence to Imbrus and Gargarus; is a correct delineation of the
striking face of nature, in which the picturesque wildness and grandeur
of real scenery are further adorned by a sublime poetical
fiction. Hence it is evident, that Homer must have lived in the
neighbourhood of Troy; that he borrowed the scene of the Iliad
from ocular examination; and the action of it from the prevailing
tradition of the times.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Clarke.</span></p></div>

(Galba 1), if compared together, make it only half the distance;
and Dionysius, (Antiq. lib. ii.) expressly places it at the distance
of one hundred stadia, or twelve miles. The Peutingerian table
